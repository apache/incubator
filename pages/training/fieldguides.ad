== Incubator Field Guides

Incubator Field Guides capture **practical lessons learned from real Apache Incubator mailing list discussions**.

All Field Guides are:
* derived from real Incubator discussions,
* anonymised and generalised,
* focused on how issues actually arise and are resolved in practice.

They are intended to save mentors, podlings, and IPMC members from having to rediscover the same lessons by reading years of archived email threads.
