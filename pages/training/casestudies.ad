These pages explore real examples of podlings’ incubation journeys. From early releases to graduation or retirement.  
They combine verified ASF data, mailing-list discussions, and board reports to show how community growth, governance, and mentoring shape outcomes.  
All content is shared for learning and discussion, not for evaluation.
