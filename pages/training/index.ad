== Training & Onboarding

Welcome to the Incubator’s training hub. Here you’ll find resources to help **mentors, IPMC members, PPMC members, and committers** learn their roles and responsibilities.

Start with your role, path, or browse the shared resources below.

New mentors, it's suggested you begin at the link:mentor/[Mentor Path] or link:paths/mentor.adoc[Mentor Essentials Path].

== Role-based learning paths

Choose resources tailored to your current role or the role you’re preparing for.

- link:mentor/[Mentor Path] — start here if you are, or plan to become, an Apache Incubator mentor  
- link:ipmc/[IPMC Path] — guidance and resources for members of the Incubator PMC  
- link:ppmc/[PPMC Path] — orientation and best practices for new Podling PMC members  
- link:committer/[Committer Path] — essential information for podling committers joining the ASF community

== Path-based learning paths

Each path links to a focused selection of guides, slide decks, videos, and scenarios that can be completed in about 30 to 60 minutes.  
They can be used for self-study or as part of structured onboarding and review.

* link:paths/mentor.adoc[Mentor Essentials Path] - Build confidence in core mentoring practices: expectations, communication on lists, balancing autonomy and support, and common early podling issues.
* link:paths/startup.adoc[Podling Startup Path] - Kickstart a new podling: ASF culture, reporting rhythm, initial governance setup, podling website/branding basics, and first-milestone planning.
* link:paths/release.adoc[Release Readiness Path] - Prepare an ASF-compliant release: artifacts, LICENSE/NOTICE checks, voting steps, publishing, and post-release follow-ups.
* link:paths/oversight.adoc[IPMC Oversight Path] - Strengthen oversight: reading signals in reports, spotting risks early, consistent review practices, and aligning feedback with ASF policy.
