== About The Incubator

The Apache Incubator provides services to projects which want to enter the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

It helps those incoming projects (called "podlings") adopt the Apache link:http://apache.org/theapacheway/[style of governance and operation] and guides them to the ASF services available to our projects so they can become top-level ASF projects ("TLPs").

The Incubator delegates a few mentors for each podling to act as liaisons with the various ASF teams: link:http://incubator.apache.org/whoweare.html#the_incubator_project_management_commitee_pmc[Incubator PMC], link:https://selfserve.apache.org/[Infrastructure team], etc., and facilitate the podling's growth and operations.

=== Incubator History

The Incubator was created link:https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2002/board_minutes_2002_10_16.txt[ in 2002].  As of November 2019 it has helped 315 podlings, of which more than 200 have graduated. More than 300 mentors have guided and supported podlings. There are around 45 or 50 podlings in incubation at any one time, and incubation typically takes 1 1/2 years.


=== Incubator Cookbook

Our link:http://incubator.apache.org/cookbook/[cookbook] helps potential podlings decide whether the ASF is a good fit for them and guides them through the steps required to become an ASF podling.
