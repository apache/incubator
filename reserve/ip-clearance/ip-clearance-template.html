<div class="section-content">
<pre>-----8-&lt;---- cut here -------8-&lt;---- cut here -------8-&lt;---- cut here-------8-&lt;----</pre>
<h3 id='premable'>Preamble</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>This document (or rather the source of it)
        is the template for recording IP clearance on new
codebases. Please store the completed document in this Incubator
repository using a filename that reflects your project.</p>
<p>One of the Incubator's roles is to ensure that proper attention is
paid to intellectual property. From time to time, an external
codebase is brought into the ASF that is not a separate project, but
still represents a substantial contribution that was not developed
within the ASF's source control system. This is a short form of the
Incubation checklist, designed to allow code to be imported with
alacrity while still providing for oversight.</p>
<p>This form is not for new projects. The intent is to simply help to
ensure, and record, that due diligence (Software Grant, Individual CLA, Corporate
CLA, license and dependencies) has been paid to the incoming code, so
that it can be merged into an existing project/module.</p>
<p>Either an Individual CLA or Corporate CLA is preferred to a Software Grant.
All authors must sign an Individual CLA; or all owners of IP must sign
one of the three documents and send to secretary (reference
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">ASF Licenses</a>).</p>
<p>The receiving PMC is responsible for doing the work. The Incubator is
simply the repository of the needed information. Once a PMC directly
checks-in a filled-out short form, everything is done.</p>
<p>All PMCs must handle incoming code in this way. Any code that was
developed outside of the ASF SVN repository must be processed like
this, even if the external developer is an ASF committer.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='process'>Process</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<ol>
            <li>
IP Clearance processing must be executed either by an Officer
or a Member of the ASF. <em>If you are not an Officer or a Member,
please contact your project chair who will find an appropriate
volunteer.</em> Incubator karma is also required. Please request
karma from the incubator pmc if you do not have it.
            </li>
            <li>
(Optional) <em>Commit an outline <a href="#form-filling">form</a>,
filling those parts which can be (at this stage)</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
A software grant must be provided to the ASF. This grant can either be
done by the ASF Corporate CLA (via Schedule B) or the Software Grant
Agreement. The completed and signed grant must be emailed to
secretary@apache.org
            </li>
            <li>
Receipt of the software grant form <strong>must</strong> be acknowledged
by an Officer of the ASF by recording in the correct file (<em>grants.txt</em> for a License Grant
or <em>cclas.txt</em> for a Corporate CLA). In most normal circumstances,
the officer should be the ASF Secretary, who must be provided a copy of
the grant or CCLA in any case (if not originally sent or Emailed
to him).
            </li>
            <li>
<strong>Note:</strong> the grant form <strong>must</strong> be acknowledged
before continuing. If the source is referenced by checksum in the grant,
commit the canonical tarball for the donated code into the incubator
drop area (/repos/asf/incubator/donations) together with a checksum
and a detached signature. This will ensure that apache has a legal record of
the grant.
            </li>
            <li>
Complete and commit the <a href="#form-filling">completed form</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
Post a message to general@incubator prefixed [IP CLEARANCE] asking for
clearance to be checked. Sign off is by lazy consensus so wait at least
72 hours for a -1.
            </li>
            <li>
Post a [RESULT] to close the thread and let the project know that the
code has been cleared for import.
            </li>
          </ol>
</div>
<h3 id='form-filling'>Filling The Form</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>What to do to set it up:</p>
<ul>
        <li>copy this file and re-name it according to
incubator/public/trunk/content/ip-clearance/${project-codebase}.xml</li>
        <li>add a row to the table at
incubator/public/trunk/content/ip-clearance/index.xml</li>
        <li>make a snapshot of the source code available for review</li>
      </ul>
<p>The snapshot should not last long in place before it is moved to the
successful incubation area. The sole purpose is to ensure that IP is
cleared so that the codebase can be merged into the ASF SVN.</p>
<p>For this file:</p>
<ul>
        <li>substitute the XYZ name with the real one</li>
        <li>fill in the description</li>
        <li>fill in the work items</li>
        <li>remove this notice</li>
        <li>set a proper "title" element for the html page</li>
