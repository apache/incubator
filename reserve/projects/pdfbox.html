            Apache PDFBox is an open source Java library for working with
            PDF documents. PDFBox entered incubation on February 7th, 2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website has been set up. The license review is underway and
            has already progressed quite far. The export control notification
            has been set up. These tasks and most other tasks were all
            performed by PDFBox mentors (mostly by Jukka Zitting). Sadly,
            there has been almost no participation by the initial
            committers, yet, except for handling the license grants and CLAs.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the user side, some questions don't seem to get answered.
            Not many patches have reached us, either.

          </p>
          <p>
            We have finally migrated all sources to Apache svn and set up
            the project website at http://incubator.apache.org/pdfbox/.
            We also set up a CI build using Hudson. Traffic is picking up
            on the user and developer mailing lists, new issues are being
            reported through Jira, and there is initial discussion about
            an incubating 0.8.0 release.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software Grants have been received from Ben Litchfield and
            Daniel Wilson who are the primary authors of the PDFBox, FontBox
            and JempBox software. There have been a lot of small
            contributions (under the BSD license) by a number of other people
            to the project and it was asked (see
            http://markmail.org/message/zy6oweihmenqt6o4) on the legal-discuss
            list whether the primary authors have "sufficient rights" to
            grant a license for all of the code, or if we have to contact
            all the other contributors for separate grants. Having received
            no response to the question on legal-discuss we assumed that
            software grants from the primary authors was sufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're discussing about what to do with the FontBox and JempBox
            codebases that are included as subprojects of PDFBox. We might
            decide to merge them with similar efforts in other Apache
            projects, most notably XML Graphics.

            The contents of the issue trackers at SourceForge have been
            migrated to Jira. We've also created a pdfbox-users mailing
            list and plan to point people from the SourceForge support
            forums to that list. The project sources have not yet been
            migrated to Apache svn.

            The basic project infrastructure (lists, svn, jira, etc.) is
            already in place, and we are currently working on migrating
            the source code and existing issues from SourceForge. We have
            also requested a user mailing list to replace the current
            help forums on SourceForge.

            PDFBox uses the Bouncy Castle crypto libraries for handling

            The PDFBox project has just entered incubation, and we're

            about the licensing of the JAI dependency was voiced on the
