<h3>October 2007</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
          Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and
          structured text content from various documents using existing
          parser libraries. Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.
        </p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>
          There have been a number of positive items within Tika during the
          last few months. The traffic on the Tika mailing list has increased
          significantly (with typically 2, 3 questions, and 1 or 2 commits
          every day, or every other day), and there have been a lot of recent
          inquiries from external projects wanting to collaborate with Tika
          (including Aperture, PDFBox and a fellow developing a JSon library
          currently hosted at Google code). In addition, Tika's architecture
          has become a recent discussion of interest (as we'll see below).
        </p>
<p>
          We recently elected Keith Bennett as a new committer to Tika.
          Keith has been spearheading many of the new patches committed to
          Tika, as well as participating in discussions about the
          architecture, and future direction of the project.
        </p>
<p>
          Tika will be represented at the "Fast Feather" track at
          ApacheCon US by Jukka Zitting. The rest of the community is helping
          to create the content for the presentation. The abstract is listed
          below:
        </p>
<blockquote>
          Tika is a new content analysis framework borne from the desire to
          factor our commonality from the Apache Nutch search engine framework.
          Tika provides a mime detection framework, an extensible parsing
          framework and metadata environment for content analysis. Though in
          its nascent stages, progress on Tika has recently taken shape and
          the project is nearing a stable 0.1 release. In this talk, we'll
          describe the core APIs of Tika and discuss its use in several
          distinct domains including search engines, scientific data
          dissemination and an industrial setting.
        </blockquote>
<p><strong>Development</strong></p>
<p>
          There have been a flurry of JIRA issues and code activity
          (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA) including 47 issues
          currently in JIRA, with 32 resolved issues, 14 closed issues,
          and 2 open major/minor issues in progress).
        </p>
<p>
          Tika's Parser interface (one of its key components) has just
          undergone a major overhaul led by Jukka Zitting, and Chris
          Mattmann has recently contributed a MimeType system (with help from
          fellow Apache Nutch committer Jerome Charron) to Tika. We also
          cleaned up and refactored large parts of the rest of the code
          (removing references to LiusLite and branding the project wherever
          possible with the Tika name), in preparation for an upcoming
          0.1 release.
        </p>
<p>
          Chris Mattmann has led an effort to carve out the existing MimeType
          detection system in Apache Nutch (http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/)
          and replace it with Tika's improved MimeType detection system.
          There is a patch sitting in JIRA right now
          (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-562), and barring
          objections, Nutch will rely on Tika for its MimeType detection
          abilities.
        </p>
<p>
          Also active recently were committers Bertrand Delacretaz, Sami
          Siren and Rida Benjelloun, committing patches and improvements
          wherever needed.
        </p>
<p><strong>Issues before graduation</strong></p>
<p>
          No changes since our last report: the Tika project is still at
          an early stage of incubation. We need to continue bringing in the
          initial codebases and are targeting an initial incubating release
          (0.1) probably within the next month. We also need to work on
          growing the community and figuring out how to best interact with
          external parser projects.

            No changes since our last report: the Tika project is still at
            an early stage of incubation. We need to continue bringing in
            the initial codebases and probably target for an initial
            incubating release later this year. We also need to work on
            growing the community and figuring out how to best interact with
            external parser projects.

          Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and
          structured text content from various documents using existing
          parser libraries. Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.
        </p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>
          The Tika mailing lists have been relatively quiet lately, probably
          because with little code we don't yet have many concrete issues
          to talk about.
        </p>
<p><strong>Development</strong></p>
<p>
          We saw the first piece of Tika code when Chris A. Mattmann ported
          the Nutch metadata framework to Tika. Rida Benjelloun has created
          a version of the Lius codebase to be included in Tika, and the
          code is currently in the issue tracker.

          We had a good project bootstrap meeting as a part of the text
          analysis BOF at the ApacheCon EU in Amsterdam. The resulting ideas
          were summarized on the project mailing list, and the first design
          threads have started.
        </p>
<p><strong>Development</strong></p>
<p>
          We've started discussing the design of the Tika toolkit. It seems
          like we will select one of the existing codebases listed in the
          project proposal as the basis of an early 0.1 release, and start
          refactoring the code into a more generic toolkit. The Tika svn
          tree is still empty, but I expect us to see the first code commits
          before the next report.
        </p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>
          All the initial infrastructure is now in place. There is still
          some activity on the temporary Tika wiki on the Google Project
          hosting service, so we may end up requesting a Tika wiki to be
          set up on the ASF infrastructure.
        </p>
<p><strong>Issues before graduation</strong></p>
<p>
          The Tika project is still at an early stage of incubation. The
          most important tasks before graduation are to develop and release
          the Tika codebase and to grow a diverse and sustainable project
          community.

          The Tika project has just started. The basic infrastructure
          (mailing lists, subversion, issue tracker, web site) is mostly
          in place; the only thing still missing is one committer account.
          We expect to get started with the actual design and code work
          during the next few weeks.
