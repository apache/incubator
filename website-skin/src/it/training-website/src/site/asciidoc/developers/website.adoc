== Generating the Website

We are currently using the normal `Maven` build to not only generate the project artifacts, but also the project's website.

In order to provide content, every module can have a `src/site` directory. This content will be generated to those modules site-part.

The `skin` being used to generate the site is none of the default `Maven` skins, but a more up-to-date looking skin using:

- Bootstrap (For the CSS)
- JQuery (For the JavaScript magic)
- Fontawesome (For icons and symbols)

But we don't have to worry about the details, all is configured to be used automatically.

The site content itself is generated from `asciidoc` files (ending `.adoc`) which is a simple yet powerful markup language.
(See http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference] or https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc cheatsheet] for details)

Beyond the basic goodies, the build is also configured to generate images from ASCII data using the `asciidoctor-diagram` plugin.

This allows us to generate images like the ones on the http://plc4x.apache.org/plc4j/plc4j-protocols/plc4j-protocol-s7/index.html[S7 Protocol Description page]

=== Providing new content

Within the `src/site` directory, there is a file `site.xml` which generally controls the menu and the look of the site.

Most settings are inherited from the `training` parent module. That's also why this is more complicated than the others.

The `site.xml` file is optional. Even if this is not available a site will be generated however no additional content will be linked from any of the navigation menus.

So if we wanted to add a new page on some (hopefully non-existent) `Cool content`, we would create a file called:

`index.adoc` in the `src/site/asciidoc/content/cool` directory.

For example with this content:

```
== Cool Hello World

Here comes some extremely cool content.

```

=== Adding links to menus

In order to add links to the menus, you have to create or modify the `site.xml` for the module you want to add content to.

The simplest form would probably be something like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

<project name="Training">

  <body>
    <menu name="content">
      <item name="cool" href="https://training.apache.org/content/cool.html"/>
    </menu>
  </body>

</project>
```

This will generate a `content` menu at the end, and this has one link named `cool`.

Notice that the link has to have a file ending of `.html` and not `.adoc`.

If you want to insert the menu somewhere else, you will have to re-define the entire menu.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

<project name="Training">

  <body>

      <menu ref="reports" inherit="top"/>
      <menu ref="parent" inherit="top"/>

      <menu name="content">
        <item name="cool" href="https://training.apache.org/content/cool.html"/>
      </menu>

      <menu ref="modules" inherit="top"/>

  </body>

</project>
```

The `menu ref` items hereby reference standard menus provided by the `Maven` build.

=== Deploying the Website

The Apache Training project uses Apache `gitpubsub` system for maintaining the website.

In general, all content in a repos `asf-site` branch is copied to the web servers, if that repo is registered for it.

The content in this branch is generated and maintained during the `Maven` build as part of the `site` generation if the `site-deploy` phase is executed.

The build system needs to check-in content to the `asf-site` branch and usually the ASF Jenkins nodes don't have the permissions to do that.

In order to be able to push to the `asf-site` GIT branch, a dedicated build job is configured to build on nodes with the Jenkins label `git-websites`.

Only on these machines are jobs allowed to push changes to a Git repo and here only to a branch named `asf-site`.

See https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Training%20(incubating)/job/Training%20Multi-Branch%20Pipeline/ for details on the Training Jenkins Website build job.

As soon as the content is updated in the `asf-site` the `gitpubsub` mechanism will make those changes available at https://training.apache.org
