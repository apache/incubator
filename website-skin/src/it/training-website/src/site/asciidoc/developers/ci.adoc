== Continuous Integration

We are currently using only Apache Jenkins for building.

- Apache's Jenkins at https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Training%20(incubating)/

Only build jobs on Apache's Jenkins are allowed to publish SNAPSHOT versions of the Maven artifacts to Apaches Nexus as well as auto publish generated websites to production.

=== Structure of the Jenkins Pipeline build

We are using the Jenkins `multi-branch pipeline plugin` to automatically setup build for branches based upon the build definition in the `Jenkinsfile` in the root of the project.

In general, it decides between building the `master` branch and all others.

When building `master` the build not only builds the project itself, it also deploys the generated site content to the `asf-site` branch which deploys the website.
