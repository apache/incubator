## Reading the Indicators
- **Use trend arrows** to compare available windows; when a window lacks ≥28 days or ≥5 events, trends show **—**.
- **Look for balance:** steady releases, active community discussions, and a mix of reviewers signal healthier progress.
- **Check anomalies:** sudden drop-offs or spikes may need mentor follow-up.
- **Consider proportionality:** absolute numbers matter less than whether activity is sustainable for the project’s size.
- **Watch diversity trends:** concentration in one person or company is a risk, even if raw activity looks strong.
- **Look beyond developers:** list traffic and wider participation matter as much as GitHub stats.
- **Treat results as conversation starters:** these outputs inform mentoring; they aren’t pass/fail scores.
