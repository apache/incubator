REMARKS:

the file: src/main/resources/document.html.slim contains a copy oif the original version of the file in the asciidoctor-reveal.js-{version}/templates directory.

However we add two sets of divs in order to position logos.
Additionally we add some CSS imports for c3, d3 libraries.
All added blocks are wrapped in:

    / START ADDED For Apache Training

And

    / END ADDED For Apache Training

When updating the ascidoctor-revealjs version, this file needs to be updated too.
