# Facilitator’s Guide – Practicing The Apache Way Scenarios

This guide supports mentors, trainers, and workshop leads who use the **Practicing The Apache Way** scenario cards in group learning sessions.

It explains how to set up, run, and debrief interactive exercises that build understanding of ASF governance, mentoring, and community health.

## Recommended Formats

| Duration | Format | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 15–20 mins | **Single Scenario Discussion** | One scenario used as a quick case study in a meeting or training. |
| 45–60 mins | **Small-Group Workshop** | Groups of 3–5 each tackle a different scenario, then share insights. |
| 90 mins | **Full Session** | Mix of short rotations: decision-making, mentoring, community health, graduation readiness. |

---

## Session Flow

### 1. Introduction (5 min)
Remind participants that the Apache Way is **not a checklist**, but a culture of learning and trust. Each scenario comes from real Incubator experiences (anonymized).

> *Ask:* “What does governance look like in everyday ASF work?”

---

### 2. Group Work (15–25 min)
Give each group one or two printed cards (front = story nd questions, back = possible solutions).  
Have them read silently, then discuss:

- What’s happening in this situation?  
- What ASF values or policies are involved?  
- How might mentors, PPMC, or IPMC members respond?  
- What could have prevented the issue earlier?

Encourage them to write a **one-sentence takeaway**:  
> “This scenario reminds us to… [core lesson].”

---

### 3. Debrief (10–20 min)
Bring groups together to compare outcomes.

**Facilitator prompts:**
- What patterns do you notice between scenarios?
- Were there any “gray areas” with no clear rule?
- How does transparency help in each example?
- How does this apply to your own project or mentoring?

Summarize with a few ASF principles in practice:
- *Decisions happen on the public list.*  
- *Mentors guide, but do not control.*  
- *Reports are about learning, not performance.*  
- *Community over code.*  

---

## Tips for Facilitators

- **Rotate roles:** Ask one participant to read aloud, another to note lessons, another to summarize the group’s response.
- **Normalize imperfection:** Remind participants that most ASF learning happens through mistakes and reflection.
- **Model consensus:** When differing opinions arise, demonstrate how to build agreement instead of voting immediately.
- **Use “What if?” questions:**  
  “What if the mentor had responded sooner?”  
  “What if the discussion stayed off-list?”
- **Connect scenarios:** Link similar themes across cards (e.g., *Lazy Consensus Gone Wrong* ↔ *Ambiguous Vote Scope*).

---

## Reflection Prompts

- How does this situation test ASF cultural values?  
- How might this lesson apply beyond incubation?  
- Who should take action — the PPMC, mentors, or the IPMC?  

---

## Variations

### Clustered Themes

Lay cards face up on a table or wall and sort them by **topic**.  
Ask participants to identify common principles or warning signs across similar scenarios.  
Some cards may fit more than one theme — that’s part of the discussion.

**Suggested categories and examples:**

| Theme | Example Scenarios | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Voting and Consensus** | Lazy Consensus Gone Wrong, Ambiguous Vote Scope, Cross-List Release Vote Confusion, The Off-List Decision | How communities record consensus, clarify scope, and ensure transparency between podling and IPMC. |
| **Mentoring and Oversight** | The Silent Mentor, The Over-Involved Mentor, Unclear Boundaries Between Mentor and PPMC, The Conflicted PPMC, The Unreliable Narrator, The Glossed-Over Report, Unrealistic Expectations of ASF Infrastructure, Mentors Added for the Wrong Reasons, Delayed Mentor Escalation, Conflicting Mentor Advice | How mentors balance advice with autonomy, recognize bias, and coordinate consistent guidance. |
| **Conflict Resolution and Communication** | The Heated Thread, Private Discussions and Missing Context, Cultural Misunderstanding | How tone, culture, and inclusion affect trust and collaboration. |
| **Community Health and Growth** | The Single-Maintainer Risk, The Employer-Dominated Podling, Quiet Lists, Fading Energy, The Overlooked Contributor, The Reluctant Leader, Corporate Withdrawal and Loss of Momentum | Signals of sustainability or fragility in participation and diversity. |
| **Podling Readiness and Graduation** | Ready… or Rushed?, Mentor Dependency, The Graduation Vote, The Graduation Surprise | How communities demonstrate maturity and independence before graduation. |
| **Branding and Legal in Practice** | Branding Confusion, Missing License Headers, Handling Contributor Data, Brand and Governance Blur, Release Hygiene in Practice | How podlings apply ASF’s branding, licensing, and privacy rules in practice. |
| **Long-Term Sustainability** | Graceful Retirement, The Disappearing Mentor, Chair Transition, Not Leadership Change, The Dormant TLP | Maintaining health and continuity once mentors have stepped back. |

**Facilitator cues**
- Ask each group why they grouped certain cards together.  
- Highlight recurring ASF values such as *transparency*, *community over code*, and *trust through contribution*.  
- Note that several cards can bridge multiple themes — e.g., *Mentor Dependency* fits both Mentoring and Graduation discussions.

### Timeline Game

Arrange cards along a rough lifecycle showing how podlings learn The Apache Way through real challenges.  
Each scenario fits where it most often arises — though some can appear again later.

---

#### **Early Incubation**
*Forming habits, learning ASF processes, establishing mentor roles, and building transparent communication.*

- Mentors Added for the Wrong Reasons  
- Unrealistic Expectations of ASF Infrastructure  
- The Off-List Decision  
- Ambiguous Vote Scope  
- Lazy Consensus Gone Wrong  
- Cross-List Release Vote Confusion

💡 *Facilitator cue:*  
Ask: “Which of these early missteps might set lasting patterns if uncorrected?”  
Emphasize mailing list culture, clear voting scope, and active mentorship from the start.

---

#### **Mid-Incubation — Building Healthy Practice**
*Communities learn balance: mentors step back, contributors step up, and governance becomes routine.*

- Release Hygiene in Practice  
- Missing License Headers  
- The Silent Mentor  
- The Over-Involved Mentor  
- Unclear Boundaries Between Mentor and PPMC  
- The Conflicted PPMC  
- The Unreliable Narrator  
- The Glossed-Over Report  
- Conflicting Mentor Advice  
- Private Discussions and Missing Context  
- Cultural Misunderstanding  
- The Heated Thread  
- The Overlooked Contributor  
- The Employer-Dominated Podling  
- The Single-Maintainer Risk  
- Branding Confusion  
- Brand and Governance Blur  
- Mentor Dependency

💡 *Facilitator cue:*  
Invite groups to find “inflection points” — moments when communication, mentorship, or governance adjustments could have changed a podling’s path.  
These illustrate what healthy ASF culture looks like in action.

---

#### **Late Incubation — Readiness & Sustainability Checks**
*The community tests its independence, legal hygiene, and ability to self-correct.*

- Handling Contributor Data  
- Delayed Mentor Escalation  
- Quiet Lists, Fading Energy  
- Corporate Withdrawal and Loss of Momentum  
- Ready… or Rushed?  
- The Graduation Vote  
- The Graduation Surprise  
- Graceful Retirement
- The Reluctant Leader  

💡 *Facilitator cue:*  
Ask: “Which show readiness for graduation, and which reveal gaps still to close?”  
Remind participants that transparency and self-correction signal maturity more than perfection.

---

#### **Post-Graduation — Sustaining Independence**
*Life after incubation: maintaining trust, continuity, and participation without IPMC oversight.*

- The Disappearing Mentor  
- Chair Transition, Not Leadership Change  
- The Dormant TLP

💡 *Facilitator cue:*  
Discuss how ASF values continue after graduation, especially around leadership rotation, public reporting, and community health.

## Remote or Online Facilitation

For virtual workshops or distributed mentoring teams:

- **Use digital tools:** Present cards via shared slides or PDFs.
- **Breakout rooms:** Assign one scenario per room with a 15–20 minute timer. Rotate participants between rooms if time allows.  
- **Shared debrief:** Bring everyone back for summary discussion. Use a shared board to collect takeaways.  
- **Encourage equal participation:** Ask quieter voices first; use the chat for quick reflections.  
- **Record insights:** Summaries can later be anonymized and shared with the IPMC or training wiki.

---

## After the Workshop

Encourage participants to:
- Read the full guide: [Practicing The Apache Way (Wiki)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/Practicing+The+Apache+Way)
- Reflect on how their own podling or mentorship could improve transparency

Optional follow-up:
- Share outcomes or new scenario ideas on `general@incubator.apache.org`
- Contribute updates or facilitation notes back to the wiki or training repository
