# Presentation with Reveal.JS and AsciiDoctor

Remarks:
- Currently it seems as if the system can't detect the 'docinfo' files, so we have to replace the `document.html.slim` file from `asciidoctor-reveal.js` with an updated one, that adds some additional js and css references. This template is located in `libs/docinfo-hack`.
- In order to use the preview of the IntelliJ asciidoctor plugin, you need to set an attribute in the plugin settings: `imagesdir` = `../resources/images`
- Even if it is possible to run the presentation directly from the `generated-slides` directory, some JavaScript extensions don't work in this case. Therefore it is required to run the presentation from a local webserver. 
- In order to generate the diagrams, GraphVIS needs to be installed locally. Get it from: http://www.graphviz.org/
- The template is adjusted to use the codecentric font `Panton`, so be sure to have that installed on your presentation machine.
- Any css adjustments can go to `src/main/theme/cc.css` as this is automatically embedded into the themes directory.

## Building the presentation

By running the following command, you can generate the presentation:

    mvn clean package
   
## Running the presentation

In order to start a local web server serving the presentation, execute the following command:

    mvn jetty:run-exploded
    
As soon as that's done, just point your browser to:

    http://localhost:8080/

## Generating PDF versions

In order to generate a PDF version of the presentation just add `?print-pdf` to the url. (Keep in mind, that you have to add it before any `#blahblah`)

The following link should do the trick:

    http://localhost:8080/?print-pdf
    
As soon as that's loaded, just use the normal `print` functionality of the browser and `print as PDF`.

## Installing third party software:

### Mermaid

    npm install mermaid.cli
    
This will install mermaid under `node_modules/.bin/mmdc`.

### PhantomJS
