## Scoring Guidance

Each category is scored **0–2**.  
- **0 = Not yet visible / needs support**  
- **1 = Emerging / developing**  
- **2 = Established / healthy**  

### Overall Rating
- **10–12 points** → **On Track** — Podling shows strong signals of community health and ASF alignment. Maintain the current pace and begin planning toward graduation milestones.  
- **6–9 points** → **Making Progress** — Podling is moving forward, but a few areas need extra attention. Work with mentors to set one to two clear goals for the next quarter.  
- **0–5 points** → **At Risk** — Key signals are missing or weak. Collaborate with mentors and the IPMC to agree on a short-term recovery plan. If challenges persist, re-evaluate the podling’s path.
