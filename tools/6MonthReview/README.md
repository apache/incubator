# Apache Incubator 6-Month Review

This README explains how to review and update the **auto-generated 6-Month Podling Review reports** used by the Apache Incubator.  

These reviews are part of an **optional experimental process** to help mentors and the IPMC gain additional insight into podling progress and community health.

---

## Location of Reports

All generated reports are available in the Incubator GitHub repository:  
https://github.com/apache/incubator/tree/master/tools/6MonthReview/reports

Each report is named using the format:  
`<podling-name>_6mo_review.md`

Example: `hamilton_6mo_review.md`

## Purpose

The 6-Month Review experiment provides a lightweight, data-assisted checkpoint during incubation.  

It helps mentors and the IPMC:
- Identify early progress and risks.  
- Support podlings in aligning with ASF culture and governance.  
- Encourage discussion rather than evaluation.  

These reviews do not replace monthly reports and are not formal assessments.

## How It Works

Each report is auto-generated with:
- Podling details – name, start date, mentors, age.  
- Auto-filled metrics – mailing list activity, GitHub data, releases, mentor sign-offs.  
- Suggested scores (0–2) – estimated indicators for:  
  Community Building, Decision-Making and Culture, Releases and Process, Mentorship, and Sustainability.  
- Scoring guidance – brief explanations of what each score range represents.  

All values and scores are suggestions only and must be reviewed and adjusted by mentors or IPMC members.

## Review Process

1. Locate the relevant file in the reports directory.  
2. Verify that auto-filled metrics (for example, email counts, releases, pull requests) are accurate.  
3. Adjust suggested scores where needed based on real activity and ASF culture.  
4. Provide a short summary or recommendation if appropriate.  
5. Save and commit the reviewed file.  

Each review should involve at least one mentor.

## Score Overview

| Total | Category | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| 10–12 | On Track | Healthy ASF alignment and consistent growth |
| 6–9 | Making Progress | Positive trajectory with some gaps |
| 0–5 | At Risk | Needs additional mentor or IPMC support |

Scores are guidance only — discussion and human interpretation matter more than numbers.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |

| Mentors | Validate metrics and adjust suggested scores |
