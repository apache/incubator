<h3 id='incubator'>1. Incubation</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<h4 id='does_project_X_really_need_Incubation'>1.1. Does the X Project really have to go in the Incubator to
                 get to Apache?</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Code that has existed outside the ASF can <strong>only</strong>
             enter the ASF through the Incubator. There is no other option.</p>
<p>The Incubator, among other things, is where the due-diligence of
             making sure the licence is correct, the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#grants">copyright license</a>
              is received, and all of the initial developers submit their <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">CLAs</a>.</p>
<p>The Incubator is also the place where projects can familiarize
             themselves with how the ASF works under the guidance of Incubator
             PMC members (<a href="incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Mentors">mentors</a>).</p>
</div>
<h4 id='can_Incubation_be_skipped'>1.2. I'm the mentor of this project, and I think that I'm
                 able to do it by myself. The Incubator doesn't add anything,
                 can it be skipped?</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do it right, do it well, and add something in the process.</p>
<p>Incubation is not about handing it over to some other group and
             seeing what happens. The Incubator is simply the name of the place
             that governs your actions when you process a new project into
             Apache.  It moves at the same rate you do, and achieves whatever
             you achieve -- the only difference is that we have a permanent
             record in <strong>one</strong> place that we can go back to if
             there are later IP problems, and there is a gate that must be
             passed through before the project is given the right to release
             software on behalf of the ASF.</p>
<p>That gate will not be ignored or bypassed just because one
             group or another feels they have earned the right to bypass it;
             allowing that kind of exception destroys the potential to build a
             tradition of effective oversight, which is the reason we created
             the incubator.</p>
</div>
<h4 id='project_XXX_makes_no_mention_of_Incubator'>1.3. Project XXX makes no mention of the Incubator for
                 accepting new projects, but the Incubator site says that all
                 projects entering Apache must pass the Incubator. What do we
                 need to do, to move to the Apache XXX project?</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The incubation process, WRT responsibilities, is roughly as
             follows:</p>
<ol>
            <li>Any Apache PMC (project management commitee), including the
                Incubator PMC itself, will approve the entrance of a project
                at Apache.  They are the <a href="incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Sponsor">Sponsor</a>.  (In rare cases, the Apache Board of Directors
                will approve the entrance of a project.)</li>
            <li>The Incubator PMC is from that moment on responsible for the
                project.  The assigned <a href="incubation/Roles_and_Responsibilities.html#Mentors">Mentors</a> (an ASF member who has volunteered to help with
                the incubation process) will have the primary responsibility
                for overseeing the progress of the project.  Each quarter, the
                project will submit an update to the entire Incubator PMC as
                to the progress in Incubation.</li>
            <li>This will remain so until the Incubator PMC approves the
                project to be "graduated".  After graduation, if another
                PMC sponsored the podling, it will then be transferred to
                the PMC that asked for incubation.  If the PMC was the
                Incubator itself or the Board, the project must then also be
                be approved by the Board to receive its own PMC.</li>
            <li>At this point, Incubation is complete.</li>
          </ol>
<p>So, since you would like to have a place under the XXX Project,
             ask that PMC to sponsor you.  After that vote, you will
             automatically be under the Incubator, and incubation will
             start.</p>
</div>
<h4 id='proposed_new_codebase'>1.4. Someone has proposed that their code/project be donated
                 to project X within the ASF for continued development. What
                 do we need to do to accept the code?</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The Incubator will only accept code for incubation if a PMC
             has voted to accept it. So when a proposal for the donation of
             code occurs, the project in question should discuss the proposal
             (usually on their public mailing lists!), leading to a decision
             by that project's PMC on whether or not to sponsor the code (and
             potentially the project surrounding it).</p>
<p>If the PMC agrees, then the incubator can be approached, and the
             code accepted for incubation. The grant needs to be recorded by
             following the procedure outlined at the <a href="ip-clearance/">IP Clearance forms</a>.</p>
</div>
<h4 id='whose_code'>1.5. The code came from outside the ASF, so it's ours to do
                 as we like, right?</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Here are some generally agreed points that you should take
             into consideration:</p>
<ol>
            <li>No codebase within the ASF is to be considered an exclusive
                location for a general technology within the ASF.</li>
            <li>All initial codebases are just that: initial. Once the code is
                here, if people feel that the code sucks or the architecture
                sucks, or whatever else someone wants to complain about,
                all parties understand that the future direction of the
                architecture and code is, as is everything at the ASF,
                subject to communal will.</li>
            <li>Other contributors interested in any ASF codebase, with or
                without existing codebases, are free to contribute, or to
                propose additional related projects.</li>
          </ol>

             If you are not a committer on the Incubator project,

            and your project status page.

</div>
<h4 id='why_not_issue_tracking_for_incubation_tracking'>2.3. Why don't we use an issue tracking system to track
                 incubation process?</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Issue trackers do not meet the long-term archival and tracking
             requirements for our legal purposes and they do not authenticate
             that the person entering the status information has the authority
             to do so, which is what we get with our version control system.</p>
<p>Note that how the actual day to day tracking of the project (i.e.
             bugs in code) is done is not the same as filing the legal forms -
             for those issues, our normal issue trackers can be used.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, SVN is our only authoritative and formal tracking
             system for incubation status.</p>
