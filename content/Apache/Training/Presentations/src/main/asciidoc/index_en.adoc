image:training.png[width=50%]

== Apache Training
* New incubating project
* Open source training material
* Create shared resources
* Slides, workshops and labs

== Why Apache Training?
* Duplicated effort
* Wisdom of the crowd
* IP approved resources
* Review of material
* Free to reuse or re-purpose under the ALv2

== What it is Not 
* A repo for all protects material
* A place to create "official" material
* To provide certifications

== Issues to Sort Out
* Content and releases
* Ownership?
* Licensing is more complex
* Is ALv2 the best license for content?
