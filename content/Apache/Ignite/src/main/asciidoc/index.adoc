== What is Apache Ignite?
Apache Ignite™ is a memory-centric distributed database, caching, and processing platform.

2 major use-cases

- In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG)
- In-Memory Database (IMDB)

== In-Memory Data Grid
IMDG = Stores data (data grid) + Processes data (compute grid)

- Stores entries in-memory
- Data is distributed among nodes
- May need external data source (DB, REST, other)
- Collocated Processing = code goes to data

== In-Memory Database
In Memory (or memory-centric) database

- Ignite has Native Persistence since V2.1
- Scalable: Each node stores only it's own data part

Ignite can be used in combined mode
(part of data is in-memory, part - persisted)

== Why you may need Apache Ignite™
- To speed up a slow traditional database by caching entries
- To cache data from remote sources (REST, SOAP, any other network protocols)
- For projects from scratch: Build a scalable solution with horizontal scaling
- To remove a computational load from overloaded database
- Avoid single point of failure by changing traditional database to cluster

== Nodes
Apache Ignite cluster consists of two (major) type of nodes

- Server node
* Can store data
* Can execute compute jobs
* Usually, standalone JVM

- Client node
* Used to connect to the cluster

== Setting up a project

Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compile group: 'org.apache.ignite', name: 'ignite-core', version: '2.7.5'
----

Maven
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
  <artifactId>ignite-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.7.5</version>
</dependency>
----

== Download full dirstibution
Go to Ignite Project site
https://ignite.apache.org/[https://ignite.apache.org/] -> Downloads -> Binaries

Download latest binary release from the table https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi#binaries[here]

Unzip to any folder.

\bin\ignite.sh / ignite.bat will start server node

== Java Requirements
JDK 8 and later

Start script will auto-detect version of Java

https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/getting-started#section-running-ignite-with-java-9-10-11[Running using Java 9+]
from IDE requires additional parameters

[.small]`--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=java.management/com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=jdk.internal.jvmstat/sun.jvmstat.monitor=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports=java.base/sun.reflect.generics.reflectiveObjects=ALL-UNNAMED
--illegal-access=permit`

== Starting a server node
By default, Ignite starts server node
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/StartServerNode.java[tags=contains,indent=0]
----

== Starting client
Change configuration to start Ignite client
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/StartClientNode.java[tags=contains,indent=0]
----
Both server and client nodes will log

`Topology snapshot [ver=2, locNode=b5fc314f, servers=1, clients=1, state=ACTIVE, CPUs=12, offheap=3.2GB, heap=7.1GB]`

This means nodes detected each other

== Save data into Grid
Ignite supports JCache JSR 107 API,
`IgniteCache<K,V> extends javax.cache.Cache<K,V>`

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/PutGetExample.java[tags=contains,indent=0]
----

== Dynamic Cache
----
ignite.getOrCreateCache(CacheConfiguration cfg)
----

Creates an instance of the cache on the fly

----
ignite.createCache(CacheConfiguration cfg)
----

Creates cache instance

Ignite will create and deploy the cache across all server cluster members

Cache will be deployed to any new joined node

Limitation - not possible to create new cache in transaction

== Static cache
Accessed using method
----
ignite.cache(String name)
----
Will return existing cache or null

- No cache creation under running transaction

- User has to provide configuration before node startup

== Application and cache
Applications are usually made up of multiple caches

- one for each data type to be stored

-- This is a best practice

-- If you have two classes, Card and Client, you should have two caches

== Replicated and partitioned

image::replicated_vs_partitioned.png[]

Replicated - Cache A
Partitioned - Cache B & C
Replicated, use case:
rare write, often - read, e.g. dictionary

== Partitioned Caches
Most common usage of cache

.Defaults

. 1024 partitions
. No redundancy
. In-memory - volatile

WARNING: Configure backups for fault tolerance

For most cases: 1 backup is enough

== Cache Atomicity Mode
ATOMIC

- distributed transactions not supported; distributed locking not supported
- higher performance and throughput ratios

TRANSACTIONAL

- ACID Compliant
- Transaction over several caches requires all caches to be transactional

TRANSACTIONAL_SNAPSHOT

- ACID for SQL Queries

== Non SQL query Scan query
Provides iteration over cache data

May have additional filter

Filter is sent to server

Iterator over cache uses scan query

== Scan query example
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/SqlExample.java[tags=scan,indent=0]
----

== SQL support
Provides full ANSI SQL-99 support including

- aggregations
- distributed joins

Drivers

- JDBC
- ODBC

DML: SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE queries
& subset of DDL

== SQL in Apache Ignite
H2 In memory SQL database part of Ignite process

- parse/execute query
- not storage

Additional module 'ignite-indexing' is required in the classpath of all Ignite nodes.

== Adding indexing module
Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compile group: 'org.apache.ignite', name: 'ignite-indexing', version: '2.7.5'
----

Maven
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
  <artifactId>ignite-indexing</artifactId>
  <version>2.7.5</version>
</dependency>
----

== Declare cache visible as table
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/SqlExample.java[tags=entity,indent=0]
----
Otherwise:
----
IgniteSQLException: Failed to find SQL table for type: Client
----

== Declare visible entity fields
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/SqlExample.java[tags=field,indent=0]
----

email is declared to be visible by SQL engine

phoneNumber is declared as visible and index build is required

== SqlQuery
Result is a number of Java objects (entries)

Only filter condition is specified by user

"Select * from Customer" is always added automatically

Table name based on entry class name

== SqlQuery Example
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/SqlExample.java[tags=query,indent=0]
----

== SqlFieldsQuery
"Projection" of entry

Result is List<?> - fields

Subset/specific fields

Full SQL statement is required

== SqlFieldsQuery Example
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/example/SqlExample.java[tags=fields,indent=0]
