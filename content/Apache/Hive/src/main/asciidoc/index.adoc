== What is Apache Hive?
The Apache Hive â„¢ data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL.
It helps in projecting structure on data already present in a storage.

== Data Types supported in Apache Hive
Apache Hive supports following data types:

* *Numeric Types*: TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT
* *Date/Time Types*: TIMESTAMP, DATE, INTERVAL
* *String Types*: STRING, VARCHAR, CHAR
* *Misc Types*: BOOLEAN, BINARY
* *Complex Types*: arrays, maps, structs, union

== Numeric Types in Apache Hive
Numeric Types in Apache Hive are:

* *TINYINT*: (1-byte signed integer, from -128 to 127)
* *SMALLINT*: (2-byte signed integer, from -32,768 to 32,767)
* *INT/INTEGER*: (4-byte signed integer, from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
* *BIGINT*: (8-byte signed integer, from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)


== Float Types in Apache Hive
Float Types in Apache Hive are:

* *FLOAT* (4-byte single precision floating point number)
* *DOUBLE* (8-byte double precision floating point number)
* *DOUBLE PRECISION* (alias for DOUBLE, only available starting with Hive 2.2.0)
* *DECIMAL* Introduced in Hive 0.11.0 with a precision of 38 digits
* *NUMERIC* (same as DECIMAL, starting with Hive 3.0.0)

== Date/Time Types in Apache Hive
Date/Time Types in Apache Hive are:

* *TIMESTAMP*: Only available starting with Hive 0.8.0
* *DATE*: Only available starting with Hive 0.12.0
* *INTERVAL*: Only available starting with Hive 1.2.0

== String Types in Apache Hive
String Types in Apache Hive are:

* *STRING*
* *VARCHAR*: Only available starting with Hive 0.12.0
* *CHAR*: Only available starting with Hive 0.13.0

== Misc Types in Apache Hive
Misc Types in Apache Hive are:

* *BOOLEAN*
* *BINARY*: Only available starting with Hive 0.8.0

== Complex Types in Apache Hive
Complex Types in Apache Hive are:

* *arrays*: ARRAY<data_type> (Note: negative values and non-constant expressions are allowed as of Hive 0.14.)
* *maps*: MAP<primitive_type, data_type> (Note: negative values and non-constant expressions are allowed as of Hive 0.14.)
* *structs*: STRUCT<col_name : data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...>
* *union*: UNIONTYPE<data_type, data_type, ...> (Note: Only available starting with Hive 0.7.0.)

== Hive Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements
HiveQL DDL statements are as follows:

* CREATE DATABASE/SCHEMA, TABLE, VIEW, FUNCTION, INDEX
* DROP DATABASE/SCHEMA, TABLE, VIEW, INDEX
* TRUNCATE TABLE
* ALTER DATABASE/SCHEMA, TABLE, VIEW

== Hive Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements contd.
HiveQL DDL statements are as follows:

* MSCK REPAIR TABLE (or ALTER TABLE RECOVER PARTITIONS)
* SHOW DATABASES/SCHEMAS, TABLES, TBLPROPERTIES, VIEWS, PARTITIONS, FUNCTIONS, INDEX[ES], COLUMNS, CREATE TABLE
* DESCRIBE DATABASE/SCHEMA, table_name, view_name, materialized_view_name

== Hive Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Hive supports following DML statements:

* LOAD
* INSERT
* UPDATE
* DELETE
* MERGE

== Hive Data Retrieval
A SELECT statement can be part of a union query or a subquery of another query.

* table_reference indicates the input to the query.
* It can be a regular table, a view, a join construct or a subquery.
* Table names and column names are case insensitive.

== Hive SELECT query options
Hive supports following in SELECT query:

* GROUP BY
* SORT/ORDER/CLUSTER/DISTRIBUTE BY
* JOIN
* UNION
* TABLESAMPLE
* Subqueries
* Virtual Columns
