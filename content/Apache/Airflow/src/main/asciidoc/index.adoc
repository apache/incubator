== What is Apache Airflow?
Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.

== Airflow Principles

Airflow is built on following principles:

* Scalable
* Dynamic
* Extensible
* Elegant

== Airflow Principle: Scalable

Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. Airflow is ready to scale to infinity.

== Airflow Principle: Dynamic

Airflow pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.

== Airflow Principle: Extensible

Easily define your own operators and extend libraries to fit the level of abstraction that suits your environment.

== Airflow Principle: Elegant

Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parametrization is built into its core using the powerful Jinja templating engine.

== Airflow Features
Apache Airflow provides following features:

* Pure Python
* Useful UI
* Robust Integrations
* Easy to Use
* Open Source

== Airflow Feature: Pure Python

No more command-line or XML black-magic! Use standard Python features to create your workflows, including date time formats for scheduling and loops to dynamically generate tasks. This allows you to maintain full flexibility when building your workflows.

== Airflow Feature: Useful UI

Monitor, schedule and manage your workflows via a robust and modern web application. No need to learn old, cron-like interfaces. You always have full insight into the status and logs of completed and ongoing tasks.

== Airflow Feature: Robust Integrations

Airflow provides many plug-and-play operators that are ready to execute your tasks on Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and many other third-party services. This makes Airflow easy to apply to current infrastructure and extend to next-gen technologies.

== Airflow Feature: Easy to Use

Anyone with Python knowledge can deploy a workflow. Apache Airflow does not limit the scope of your pipelines; you can use it to build ML models, transfer data, manage your infrastructure, and more.

== Airflow Feature: Open Source

Wherever you want to share your improvement you can do this by opening a PR. Itâ€™s simple as that, no barriers, no prolonged procedures. Airflow has many active users who willingly share their experiences. Have any questions? Check out our buzzing slack.



== Airflow Integrations
Airflow supports following main integrations:

* Apache Sqoop
* Google Cloud Pub/Sub
* Amazon CloudWatch Logs
* Google Kubernetes Engine
* Google Machine learning
* Amazon Athena


== Airflow Providers packages
Airflow has providers packages include integrations with third party integrations. They are updated independently of the Apache Airflow core. Some of these are:

* Airbyte
* Amazon
* Apache Beam
* Apache Cassandra
* JIRA


== Airflow Docker stack
Airflow has an official Dockerfile and Docker image published in DockerHub as a convenience package for installation. You can extend and customize the image according to your requirements and use it in your own deployments.
