== What is Apache Samza?
Apache Samza is a distributed stream processing framework.
Samza allows to build stateful applications that process data in real-time from multiple sources including Apache Kafka.
Samza is battle-tested at scale, it supports flexible deployment options to run on YARN or as a standalone library.

== Samza Features
Apache Samza provides following features:

* Unified API
* Pluggability at every level
* Samza as an embedded library
* Write once, Run anywhere
* Samza as a managed service
* Fault-tolerance
* Massive scale

== Samza: Unified API

* Samza provides a simple API to describe the application-logic in a manner independent of the data-source.
* The same API can process both batch and streaming data.

== Samza: Pluggability at every level

* Samza can be used to process and transform data from any source.
* Samza offers built-in integrations with Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Azure EventHubs, ElasticSearch and Apache Hadoop.
* It’s quite easy to integrate with various data sources.

== Samza: An embedded library

* Samza can integrate effortlessly with an existing application to eliminate the need to spin up and operate a separate cluster for stream processing.
* Samza can be used as a light-weight client-library embedded in Java/Scala applications.

== Samza: Write once, Run anywhere

* Samza supports flexible deployment options to run applications anywhere.
* It can be deployed on public clouds as well as on containerized environments and bare-metal hardware.

== Samza: As a managed service

* Samza can be run for stream-processing as a managed service.
* Samza integrates with popular cluster-managers including Apache YARN.

== Samza: Fault-tolerance

* Samza transparently migrates tasks along with their associated state in the event of failures.
* Samza supports host-affinity and incremental checkpointing to enable fast recovery from failures.

== Samza: Massive scale

* Samza is battle-tested on applications that use several terabytes of state and run on thousands of cores.
* Samza powers multiple large companies including LinkedIn, Uber, TripAdvisor, Slack etc.

== Samza: Streams

* Samza processes the data in the form of streams.
* A stream is a collection of immutable messages, usually of the same type or category.
* Each message in a stream is modelled as a key-value pair.

== Samza: Partitions

* A Samza stream is sharded into multiple partitions for scaling how its data is processed.
* Each partition is an ordered, replayable sequence of records.
* When a message is written to a stream, it ends up in one of its partitions.
* Each message in a partition is uniquely identified by an offset.


== Samza State vs. Stateless

* Samza supports both *stateless and stateful* stream processing.
* *Stateless processing*, as the name implies, does not retain any state associated with the current message after it has been processed.
* *Stateful processing* records some state about a message even after processing it. Samza offers a fault-tolerant, scalable state-store for this purpose.

== Samza Processing Time

* All built-in Samza operators use processing time.
* In processing time, the timestamp of a message is determined by when it is processed by the system.
* In event time, the timestamp of an event is determined by when it actually occurred at the source.
* Samza provides event-time based processing by its integration with Apache BEAM.

==  Samza Processing guarantee

* Samza supports *at-least once* processing.
* Each message in the input stream is processed by the system at-least once.
* This guarantees no data-loss even when there are failures.

== Samza Task Execution

* Samza scales an application by logically breaking it down into multiple tasks.
* A task is the unit of parallelism for an application.
* Each task consumes data from one partition of input streams.
* The assignment of partitions to tasks never changes.
* If a task is on a machine that fails, the task is restarted elsewhere, still consuming the same stream partitions.
* Since there is no ordering of messages across partitions, it allows tasks to execute entirely independent of each other without sharing any state.

== Samza Container

* Just like a task is the logical unit of parallelism for an application, a container is the physical unit.
* Each worker is a JVM process, which runs one or more tasks.
* An application typically has multiple containers distributed across hosts.

== Samza Coordinator

* Each Samza application has a coordinator which manages the assignment of tasks across the individual containers.
* The coordinator monitors the liveness of individual containers and redistributes the tasks among the remaining ones during a failure.
* The coordinator itself is pluggable, enabling Samza to support multiple deployment options.

== Samza Incremental Checkpointing

* Samza guarantees that messages won’t be lost, even if a job crashes, if a machine dies, if there is a network fault, or something else goes wrong. To achieve this property, each task periodically persists the last processed offsets for its input stream partitions.
* If a task needs to be restarted on a different worker due to a failure, it resumes processing from its latest checkpoint.
* Samza’s checkpointing mechanism ensures each task also stores the contents of its state-store consistently with its last processed offsets. Checkpoints are flushed incrementally ie., the state-store only flushes the delta since the previous checkpoint instead of flushing its entire state.

== Samza State Management

* Samza offers scalable, high-performance storage to build stateful stream-processing applications. This is implemented by associating each Samza task with its own instance of a local database (aka. a state-store).
* The state-store associated with a particular task only stores data corresponding to the partitions processed by that task.
* Samza transparently migrates the tasks from one machine to another. By giving each task its own state, tasks can be relocated without affecting the overall application.

== Samza Programming API
Samza provides multiple programming APIs to fit a use case:

* *Java APIs*: Samza’s provides two Java programming APIs that are ideal for building advanced Stream Processing applications.
* *Samza SQL*: Samza SQL provides a declarative query language for describing the stream processing logic. It lets a user manipulate streams using SQL predicates and UDFs instead of working with the physical implementation details.
* *Apache Beam API*: Samza also provides a Apache Beam runner to run applications written using the Apache Beam API. This is considered as an extension to the operators supported by the High Level Streams API in Samza.

== Samza Java API

Samza provides two Java programming APIs that are ideal for building advanced Stream Processing applications.

* *High Level Streams API*: Samza’s flexible High Level Streams API can describe a complex stream processing pipeline in the form of a Directional Acyclic Graph (DAG) of operations on message streams. It provides a rich set of built-in operators that simplify common stream processing operations such as filtering, projection, repartitioning, joins, and windows.
* *Low Level Task API*: Samza’s powerful Low Level Task API can be used to write an application in terms of processing logic for each incoming message.
