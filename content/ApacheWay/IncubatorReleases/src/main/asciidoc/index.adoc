== Who am I?
include::aboutme.adoc[]

ifdef::IANAL[]
== I am not a Lawyer
* I’m not a lawyer, and nothing on these sides is legal advice
* Occasionally I get things wrong
* My understanding has changed over time
* Sometimes it's complex, and there's more than one “right” answer
* I’m a volunteer and not paid to do this. Not even by my day job
* This talk contains my views and may not represent the incubator as a whole
endif::[]

== What is the Apache Incubator?
* Main entry point for new projects
* Where communities come to learn the Apache Way
* Links existing projects with a community around them

== Why we Have an Incubating Process?
* Ensure donations comply with the Apache 2.0 license
* Podling follows the ASF structure of contributors, committers and PMC members
* Podling grants more responsibility via meritocracy
* Ensure that decision making is done in the open
* People act as individuals, not the company they work for
* Podling learns to follow the Apache Way

== The Apache Way
* Charity - For the public good. Software costs nothing
* Pragmatic - Business friendly
* Community - Collaboration, consensus and diversity
* Merit - The more you do you more responsibility you have. Not just code contributions
* Open - Everything in the public view. Discussions occur on mailing lists. Everyone can participate
* Consensus - Work together to find ways forward

== Apache License
* Permissive license - you can do what you want
* Business friendly - can be used for commercial projects
* Requires source headers, a LICENSE and (optionally) a NOTICE file
* If your are not an ASF project:
** You don't need to publish the source
** You don't have to give back to the project
** You don't need to ask for permission to use

[.notes]
--
Policy and social requirements on top of license
--

== State of Play
include::projectstats.adoc[]
* {podlings} projects in the incubator
* {IPMCs} IPMC members (but not all are active)
* Projects usually stay around 2 years in the incubator
* A dozen or so successful releases a month
* About 80% of releases pass the incubator

== Source Releases
* Must be cryptographically signed
* Must have an incubating disclaimer (there's two now)
* Have LICENSE and NOTICE file that follow Apache policy
* Follow licensing terms of any 3rd party bundled software
* 3rd party files are compatible with the Apache license
* Source files have ASF headers
* Contain source code and no compiled code

== Work in Progress Disclaimer
* Less strict and your release may not comply with ASF policy
* Must still be legal
* You can list known issues
* Issues noted must be fixed before graduation

[.notes]
--
Lets you get on with making release and moving towards graduation
--

== Incubator Vote Process
* Podling creates a release candidate
* Vote on dev mailing list until 3 +1 votes and more +1 than -1
* If vote fails need to make a new release candidate
* Vote on incubator general mailing list
* Need 3 +1 and more +1 than -1 by IPMC members
* If vote fails need to make a new release candidate
* Can release once vote passes and 72 hours pass

[.notes]
--
72 hours is a guideline. In fact most "rules" are guidelines.
--

== Why Your Release May Get a -1
* Unexpected binary in the source release
* Includes Category X licensed software (usually GPL)
* Included Category B license software
* LICENSE or NOTICE issue
* Copyright issue
* Missing license header or header issue
* Contains encryption software

== Representative Voting
* About 80% of releases pass 
* Slight improvement on past years
* Work in progress disclaimer will change this

== -1 is Not a Veto
* Release votes need 3 +1 votes and more +1 than -1 votes to pass
* Only IPMC votes are binding but good to take notice of other votes
* People can change their minds and vote again
* People can put up conditional votes
* A -1 vote needs a good reason

== It Doesn't Have to be Perfect
* Incubating projects are not expected to get it right the first time
* May not be familiar with policy at the start
* Policy an guidelines doesn't cover all situations
* Different projects may do things in different ways
* A release containing no surprises is a good thing

== Make it Easy to Review
* Don't make people have to think hard about it
* Provide well-named artefacts
* Don't try to be clever with licensing or headers or rat exclusions
* Include compile instructions in the release
* Make it easy to compile

== There's Not One Right Answer
* Documentation can sometimes be confusing and sometimes out of date
* Some cultural knowledge isn't well documented
* Large IPMC and some differing opinions on what is “correct”
* Often multiple ways to solve the same issue
* If in doubt err on the side of caution, often changes needed are minimal

.[.notes]
--
Again guidelines not rules. You can do things in a different way.
--

== Top Level Projects As Examples
* Policy changes over time / may be out of date
* A project may have its own reasons for doing something in a certain way
* Take care when looking at TLPs for examples
* Probably better to look at TLPs that have recently graduated

== Cryptographic Signing
* Release must be cryptographically signed
* Keys need to be RSA with at least 4096 bits
* Good idea to use an apache.org email address
* Use sha256 or sha512 for hash

== Disclaimer
* Two different disclaimers
* Put in a file called DISCLAIMER or DISCLAIMER_WIP
* Could also be in README

== Tagging
* Good idea to tag releases
* That way that can be easily compared to what is released
* Can also be easily checked out and built if needed in the future
* Note that git tags can be changed so provide hash in vote email

== Licensing
* This is where a lot of the issues occur
* Observed some reluctance to understand
* Language barrier to even those who speak English
* Can be complex
* ASF Policy does change over time

== Legal vs Policy
* Licenses provide certain legal obligations you need to comply with
* Apache policy adds a little more:
** Need to have NOTICE file
** List all licenses in LICENSE (even if it's not required)
** Respect 3rd party licenses and headers

[.notes]
--
Last is more a social convention, ask permission even if the license allows use.
--

== Developers vs Licensing
* We're not the only people who have difficulty or frustration with licensing
* Apache projects tend to be on average a lot better!
* External projects often:
** Have unclear licenses
** Include code under a different, sometimes incompatible, licenses
** If Apache 2.0 licensed are missing a NOTICE file
** Try to use funny licenses

=== 33 Copies of BSD
video::33BSD.mp4[]

=== WTF Intel Lawyers
video::wtf.mp4[]

=== Only Dead People
video::deadpeople.mp4[]

=== GPL or BSD?
video::both.mp4[]

== Documentation Issues vs Errors
* It's better to have a documentation issue than a licensing error
* Minor issues are OK to be fixed in the next release
* If you're unsure a license should be listed list it

== Universal Donor
* Give anyone confidence they can use our software without any legal issues
* All software within an artefact is compatible with the Apache 2.0 licence
* Means it can be used for commercial and non-commercial purposes

== Guiding Principle
* The LICENSE and NOTICE files accurately represent the contents of the distribution they belong to
* Don't mention stuff that's not include in the release
* There's need to mention external dependencies in LICENSE and NOTICE
* Applies to both source and binary artefacts

== May Contain Nuts
* When bundling software check to see what it contains
* In particular look for Category B and Category X software
* Look at photos or other resources like fonts that you may not have permissions to distribute or may be under another license
* Check links in code
* Manual inspection is not always required but often a good idea

== Rat
* Great tool for finding binaries and licenses in your source release
* Not perfect but very handy
* Will not find double headers
* Will not check for multiple licenses in the same file
* Only knows about a few licenses
* Often exclusions can be too wide and miss something

== Rat Output
image::rat.png[]

== Finding Licenses
* One way is to use find and grep +
`find . -type f -exec grep -i "$1" {} \;`
* Search for common license names “GPL”, “BSD”, “MIT”
* Search for “copyright” and pipe to sort -u
* Compare between releases

== Pesky JS files
* JS files, especially minified ones, are often missing license headers or license details
* Some license require full text to be contained somewhere
* Lots are under non-Apache licenses including GPL
* Other included other bundled software e.g. jQuery and Bootstrap
* Licenses change between versions
* Take care!

== Other People’s Cat Photos
* Copy all the images! +
`find . -name "*.jpg" -exec cp {} images \;`
* View all images using your OS or favourite image browsing tool
* If you find something that may be suspect:
** Look at image metadata
** Find it with a Google reverse image search

== Troublesome Fonts
* Licensing around fonts can be complex
* Look at font meta-data
* Make sure you have permission to distribute
* As fonts are binary may not be evident to users how they are licensed. You may want to make that clear in the LICENSE file

== License File
* License file named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt in the root directory
* Contains Apache license and list of licenses of bundled software in a distribution
* Short form pointer to license preferred
* May have different contents for source and binary

== License File
image::LICENSE.png[]

== Notice File
* Contains ASF copyright and developed at the ASF notice
* Keep year up to date
* Only add what is needed
** Relocated copyright notices
** Content from bundled Apache software notice files
** All other required notices
* In general licensing info shouldn't be in the notice file

== Notice file
image::NOTICE.png[]

== Required Notices
* Some confusion to what to what a required notice is
* Advertising clauses (but are probably category X)
* Link to the  source / how to get original
* State changes made
* Are not copyright notices

== Category A
* Can bundle software and can depend on
* Doesn't add any restrictions above and beyond what the Apache License 2.0 does
* Common licenses include: +
Apache License 2.0, Apache License 1.1, 2 or 3 clause BSD (without advertising clause), MIT/X11, W3C, Unicode, CC copyright only

== Category B
* Probably can't include in a source release
* Contains some restriction of use
* May be able to use the binary form to limit the chance of corruption
* Common license include: +
Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), Eclipse Public License (EPL), Mozilla Public License (MPL), most Creative Common licenses

== Category X
* Can't depend on
* Can't bundle software
* A few exceptions for build tools and optional dependencies
* Common Category X include: +
GPL, LGPL, CC non commercial, JSON, BSD 4 clause, Apache 1.0?

== No Unexpected Binary Files
* No compiled source in a source release
* No exes, dlls, jars or class files please
* No minified JS without source

== Headers
* All Apache licensed source files should have an ASF header
* Don't include a copyright line
* Use correct header

== Can Compile From Code
* Helps to have clear instructions on how to in the release
* If it doesn't work on a platform, please note that
* If you need to install a 3rd party component to get it to compile, please note that
* Make it easy to compile

== Apache Wombat
* Fictional Apache project bundling Bootstrap 3.3.2
* Showing how to assemble LICENSE and NOTICE
* Github with explanation and check-in step by step showing changes +
https://github.com/justinmclean/ApacheWombat
* Short screen cast (5 minutes) video of assembly +
https://vimeo.com/171210141

=== Wombat Walk Through
* Get boilerplate LICENSE and NOTICE files via curl
* Get NOTICE file to correct copyright and year
* Add Bootstrap's MIT license to LICENSE
* index.html contains HTML shiv which is dual licensed MIT/GPL
* Add HTML shiv MIT to LICENSE
* index.html depends on Respond.js and jQuery but not bundled
* Bootstrap bundles normalize.js add MIT to LICENSE
* Glyphicon fonts are MIT license add to LICENSE

== Nice to Haves
* Up to date README
* Up to date CHANGES
* KEYS file published
* list of DEPENDENCIES

== Common Mistakes
* Unexpected binary files in the source release
* Contents of LICENSE and NOTICE files
* Source and binary have same LICENSE and NOTICE
* Missing headers
* Issues missed due to Rat exclusions
* Issues missed due to automation
* Missing DISCLAIMER
* Release not in the correct place

== Binary Distributions
* Not considered an official release
* Need to comply the same way with ASF policies as source distributions
* LICENSE and NOTICE may be different as the contents of the release is often different from the source release

== Where to Ask for Help
* Ask on your mailing lists
* Ask your mentors
* Email the incubator mailing list at: + 
general@incubator.apache.org
* Email the legal discuss mailing list at: +
legal-discuss@apache.org

== The Incubator is Broken
* Every few years this comes up, I don't think it is, but like most things, it's not perfect
* It adds a lot of value for a relatively small amount of work for those involved
* Follow the general list and see what issues incubating projects do/don't run into
* We could do with more help. Get involved! You don't have to be an ASF member
* We need more people reviewing releases and helping improve documentation

== We're here to help +
How can we improve?
Please email the incubator mailing list at: +
general@incubator.apache.org
We're happy to talk about it. Perhaps a bit too much :-)
