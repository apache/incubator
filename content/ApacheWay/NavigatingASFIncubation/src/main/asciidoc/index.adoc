== Who am I?
include::aboutme.adoc[]

== What is the ASF?
include::projectstats.adoc[]
* World’s largest Open Source Foundation
* A neutral space where independent projects can prosper
* Creates open source software for the public good free of charge
* Business friendly Apache License 2.0
* {committers} committers, {members} members, {PMCs} PMCs, {podlings} podlings

== What is the Apache Incubator?
* Where communities come to learn the Apache Way
* Likes existing projects with a community around them
* Main entry point for new projects

== ! 
image::IncubatingProjects.png[]

== Why Come to Apache?
* Open community development
* Move away from vendor driven development
* Grow your community
* No one is the boss

== Why Should you Incubate?
* Learn the Apache Way
* Learn ASF policies
* To grow a community
* To foster independence
* To clarify licensing and intellectual property rights

== Why we Have an incubating Process?
* Podling follows the Apache Way
* Ensure donations comply with the Apache 2.0 license
* Podling follows the ASF structure of contributors, committers and PMC members
* Podling grants more responsibility via meritocracy
* Ensure that decision making is done in the open
* People act as individuals, not the company they work for

== The Apache Way
* Charity - For the public good. Software costs nothing.
* Pragmatic - Business friendly.
* Community - Collaboration, consensus and diversity.
* Merit - The more you do you more responsibility you have. Not just code contributions.
* Open - Everything in the public view. Discussions occur on mailing lists. Everyone can participate.
* Consensus - Work together to find ways forward.

=== The Apache Way - Charity
* No charge for Apache software
* We rely on donations to keep things running
* Few paid staff, everyone is a volunteer
* Not “pay to play”

=== The Apache Way - Pragmatic
* Apache License 2.0 is business friendly
* No obligation to give anything back
* Diverse communities
* Few hard rules, but have guidelines to help projects
* Don’t need to work on it full time

=== The Apache Way - Community
* Many people working together
* More resources than a single company
* Diversity of people, experience and ideas
* Individuals not companies
* Given responsibility via earning merit
* Discussion on the mailing list

=== The Apache Way - Merit  
* Individuals gain merit by contributing to a project
* Users become contributors become committers become PMC members
* PMC appoints new PMC and committer members
* Merit does not expire
* Committers get access to the repository
* PMC vote on releases
* PMC decide the direction of the projects via consensus

=== The Apache Way - Open
* Everything (mostly) is available to the public
* What isn’t public is available to all members
* Code is made publicly available
* All discussions made in the open
* Discussion are archived and searchable
* Discussions are asynchronous
* No face to face meetings
* Everyone knows what is going on

=== The Apache Way - Consensus
* Community works towards consensus on major decisions
* Use lazy consensus for minor ones
* Not 100% agreement, but all agree it is a way forward

== Apache License
* Permissive license - you can do what you want
* Business friendly - can be used for commercial projects
* Requires source headers, a LICENSE and (optionally) a NOTICE file
* If not an ASF project:
** You don’t need to publish the source
** You don’t have to give back to the project
** You don’t need to ask for permission to use

== State of Play
* {podlings} projects in the incubator
* {IPMCs} IPMC members (but not all are active)
* Projects usually stay 1 to 2 years in the incubator
* A dozen or so successful releases a month
* About 70% of releases pass an IPMC vote

== How to Get Into the Incubator
* Find a champion to help you through the proposal process
* Draft a proposal with details why you think it’s suitable
* Find (usually 3) mentors to help you guide you through the TLP process
* May take a little while to go through these steps
* Discuss on the incubator general mailing list (which may attract more potential committers)
* IPMC Votes on the proposal - most are accepted

== Acceptance Into the Incubator
* The Champion's role is over and they are more like a mentor from this point on
* Mentors help with setup of the podling
* Setup includes the mailing lists, version control, bug tracking and web site
* Have initial committers sign ICLAs and add to podling roster
* Bring initial code in via a software grant

== What to do During Incubation
* Create your website
* Learn how to make software releases and refine your build process
* Grow the community by adding new committers
* Learn to communicate in the open
* Scrub your code and perform IP clearance
* May need to relicense 3rd party code

== Build a Community
* Open asynchronous communication on email lists
* Decisions need to be made in the open
* JIRA / git discussion also OK (mirrored to list)
* Project independence with no company influence
* Welcoming to new people
* Answer user questions
* Add new committers and PPMC members

== How to Get Out
* Become a Top Level Project
* Retire

== Source Releases
* Must be cryptographically signed
* Must have an incubating disclaimer
* Have LICENSE and NOTICE file that follow Apache policy 
* Follow licensing terms of any 3rd party bundled software
* 3rd party files are compatible with the Apache license
* Source files have ASF headers
* Contain source code and no compiled code

== Release Vote Process
* Podling creates a release candidate
* Vote on dev mailing list until 3 +1 votes and more +1 than -1
* If vote fails need to make a new release candidate
* Vote on incubator general mailing list
* Need 3 +1 and more +1 than -1 by IPMC members
* If vote fails need to make a new release candidate
* Can release once vote passes and 72 hours pass

== Representative Voting
image::VoteData.png[votedata,500]

== Why Your Release May Get a -1
* Unexpected binary in the source release
* Includes Category X licensed software (usually GPL)
* Included Category B license software
* LICENSE or NOTICE issue
* Copyright issue
* Missing license header or header issue
* Contains encryption software

== -1 is Not a Veto
* Release votes need 3 +1 votes and more +1 than -1 votes to pass
* Only IPMC votes are binding but good to take notice of other votes
* People can change their minds and vote again
* People put up conditional votes
* That being said a -1 vote is often for a good reason so you should at least look into it

== It Doesn’t Have to be Perfect
* Incubating projects are not expected to get it right the first time
* May not be familiar with policy at the start
* Policy doesn't cover all situations
* Different projects may do things in different ways, policies are in most cases guidance
* A release containing no surprises is a good thing

=== Legal vs Policy
* Licenses provide certain legal obligations you need to comply with
* Apache policy adds a little more:
** Need to have NOTICE file
** List all licenses in LICENSE (even if it not required)

=== Developers vs Licensing
* We’re not the only people who have difficulty or frustration with licensing
* Apache projects tend to be on average a lot better!
* External projects often:
** Have Unclear licenses
** Include code under a different (sometimes incompatible) licenses 
** If Apache 2.0 licensed are missing a NOTICE file
** Try to have funny licenses
