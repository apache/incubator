== How to Become an IoT Developer (and Have Fun!)
{authors}

== Who am I?
* TODO fill in you own details here

== How I Got Here
* TODO fill you your own story here

== Things Have Changed
* Access to low cost easy to program hardware
* Constrained hardware has more memory and speed
* “Modern” development tools and IDEs
* Some standardisation
* Open Source hardware community
* Open Source libraries

== Hardware is Hard
* Can’t revert changes quickly or make changes once deployed
* People underestimate the time taken of developing firmware
* It harder to debug and find errors
* Hard to update firmware (OTA)

== So you want to become an IoT developer?

== One Name Different Jobs
* You can be an IoT developer without touching the hardware
* You can be an IoT developer by developing on software that communicate with IoT devices
* I’m focussing on the embedded / hardware side but from a software point of view

== Play with Toys
* Get yourself an Arduino or Raspberry Pi or similar
* Create a project that interests you
** simple as blinking LEDs
** or monitoring your garden climate
** or displaying sport scores
** or logging your beer brewing

== Arduino

== Arduino IDE
image:arduinoIDE.png[width=90%]

== Play with your Phone
* Lots of IoT devices and boards use Bluetooth LE
* NFC can be used for many things is cheap and easy to play with
* Can get cheap NFC stickers, business cards, keychain fobs, plastic cards etc. etc.

== Create a Simple Circuit
* Get a beadboard and wires and make a simple circuit
* Try and create your prototype
* A multimeter may help here
* Depending on your style it may not look pretty

== Breadboard
image:breadboard.jpg[width=60%]

== Use Breakout Boards
* Can get a lot of pre-assembled boards
* Easy to wire up to a breadboard
* Often use standard interfaces like I2C or SPI
* Think of them as lego blocks

== Breakout Board

== Learn how to Solder
* It’s easier than you think
* Use the right tip and solder
* Use a flux pen
* Learn how to correct mistakes - solder braid
* Start with large through-hole items
* Use sockets for ICs

== Prototype
image:prototype.jpg[width=60%]

== Learn a New Language
* If you don’t know it, learn C
* Other languages exist on embedded platforms but C is most common
* May need to forget some of what you know
* C is not as complicated as you may think
* Modern C style is a little different

== Forget What You Know

int LED = 10;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
}

== Read the Classics

== Or a More Modern Book
image:cmodern.jpg[width=40%]

=== C has Improved
* K&R C, C89, C99, C11
* Well perhaps only a little :-)
* Some useful C99 features:
** bool and int types
** auto-sizing of arrays
** floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
** inline functions

=== Optimise Your Code Later
* Compiler is good at optimising code
* Only optimise if you need to
* Better to keep code simple and readable
* Refresh yourself on operator order

=== Code Carefully
* Maybe best to avoid dynamic allocation of memory
* Use pointers sensibly
* Break it up - can always inline later
* Encapsulate the hard bits
* Used appropriate sized ints
* Take care with strings

== Size Matters
* You can do a lot in a small amount of code
* An Arduino web server is about 20 lines of code and compiles down to 2K

== Generative Formula
[source,C]
--
byte gen(t int)
{
  return t * ((t >> shift 1 | t >> shift2) & mask & t >> shift3);
}

You can do a lot with a small amount of code.

== Know Some Electronic Basics
* Focus on digital logic 5V or 3.3V = 1 and 0V = 0
* Current limiting leds
* Transistors for switching
* Filtering caps
* Pull up / pull down resistors
* Voltage divider

== Make a PCB
* Why? Making physical stuff is fun!
* Start with basic PCB layout program like Fritzing
* It has breadboard/circuit and PCB layout
* Don’t cross the tracks
* Use vias where needed
* Copper and ground fill

== Read the Data Sheets
* Learn to look for important values
* Don’t worry if you don’t understand all of it
* Often contain sample circuits - bonus!
* Can provide timing information
* Can vary a lot in quality

== Learn to Read a Circuit Diagram
* Know the basic symbols
* Know how to match up pins on ICs

== Schematic
image:schematic.png[]

== Fritzing
* http://fritzing.org/home/
* Very easy to use
* Easy export of files
* Handles surface mount and through-hole components 
* Comes with a decent library of footprints
* Breadboard view not compact

== Breadboard View

== PCB View

== Boards

== Not Just Basic Boards
image:fritzingcomplex.jpg[]

== It Works!
image:itworks.jpg[width=60%]

== Don’t Go Small Too Quickly
* Temptation to use small cheap surface mount components 
* Keeps the cost down but means the device may be hard to debug
* Increases time (or makes it impossible) to make modifications to the board
* Boards may have higher defect rates
* Physical copy and paste errors

== Test the Hardware
* Have some way of testing the hardware - usually custom program or part of the startup sequence
* Have physical test points on the board
* Make a testing rig if you need to test several boards

== Don’t Use the Hardware
* Compile and test your code locally
* Standard C will work just about everywhere
* Some platforms (like Apache Mynewt) have simulators
* Stub out things that are hardware dependant

[.notes]
--
Can be a much faster workflow to work this
Can run unit tests easily
--

== Test on the Hardware
* You need to test on real hardware
* Most modern platforms you can debug, set breakpoints, step line by line etc. etc.
* Make sure you test release builds as well as debug ones

== Watch your Memory
* While 32K or 128K sounds like a lot you may run out off memory
* Avoid dynamically allocating memory if possible
* Tools / RTOS generally have a way of showing memory usage
* Perform a burn-in test
* Make sure memory doesn’t climb over time

== Software is Always at Fault
* If something doesn’t work it’s likely to be the software, not the hardware
* If you can’t find the bug it still likely to be the software
* It likely to be in your code not in the 3rd party library used by 1000’s of people

[.notes]
--
No changing libraries will not fix it. Yes, the bug is in your code.
--

== Except When it’s the Hardware
* Hardware works except when it doesn’t 
* If you lucky it will be DOA and do nothing or have a short and consume all the power
* If you are unlucky it will mostly work.   Examples I’ve seen:
** unmarked GPS antennas passive not active
** crystals rotated 90 deg
** incorrect accelerometer circuit

== Log all the Things
* Often hard to know what hardware is doing at any point of time
* Log what going on when debugging
* Have some way of viewing the logs (especially when the debugger is connected)
* Remove most of the logging (but not all) in production

== Blinky Lghts
* Use indicator LEDs to indicate status
* But don’t be annoying

[.notes]

Blink version number

== Code on Bare Metal
* All the memory and speed is yours!
* Nothing else gets in the way
* All the bugs are yours!
* Some things can be more complex
* May have to write more code

== Use an RTOS
* Usually have some form of simple threading or tasks
* Breaking program up into tasks can simplify code
* Take care with shared resources
* May provide other benefits e.g. power consumption
* Be careful of vendor lock-in
* Can be more abstract/complex in some cases

== The Not So Fun Bits :-(
* OTA Updates
* Security
* Power

=== OTA Updates
* How do you update your device?
* Might be a lot harder than you think
* Bootloader
* Check and download new images
* Where do you store them? How do you verify them?
* Use an RTOS that supports all of this

=== Security
* Can be hard on constrained devices
* May not be able to do TLS due to memory or speed constraints
* Select platforms that have built-in crypto or can offload crypto to another chip

=== Power
* Power may be a limiting factor
* Need to sleep / deep sleep / turn off all devices
* Time to wake up
* RTOS may help here

== My Journey
* I’ve learnt lots of new skills
* Met a lot of nice people
* Been involved in several communities
* Had a lot of fun along the way
* I hope your journey will be the same
