== Apache Mynewt +
ASF's Embedded OS Project
{authors}

== Who am I?
* TODO fill in your own details here

== !
image:mynewt.png[width=50%]

== Overview
* Real-time operating system (RTOS) for low powered 32 bit embedded systems
* Think of it as "Linux for systems that can't run Linux"
* Permissive open source license
* Cross-platform / easy to move between platforms
* Security built-in / considered first
* Simple programming model

== Apache Licensed
* Licensed under the Apache License (ALv2)
* Included 3rd party software have permissive licenses (MIT/BSD)
* Can be used in commercial and open source application 
* Free to use

[.notes]
--
Mynewt project got several venders to relicense under more permissive licenses
--

== Why ASF?
* Permissive license
* Strong licensing and IP policy
* Meritocracy - anyone is free to contribute
* Has many other successful projects
* Not under one companies control and can't buy board seats
* 501(c)(3) non-profit for the public good

== Project incubation
* Ensure donations comply with the Apache 2.0 license
* Follows the ASF structure of contributors, committers and PMC members
* Grants more responsibility via meritocracy
* Ensure that decision making is done in the open
* People act as individuals, not companies
* Follows the Apache Way

== History at ASF
* Donated / proposed by Runtime
* Enters incubation November 2015
* Voted in TLP June 2017
* Apache Mynewt 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5
* Apache Mynewt 1.7 / Apache NimBLE 1.2 Aug 2019

== Mynewt RTOS
* Multitasking RTOS
* Power management
* Watchdog
* Secure boot loader and image update
* Stats and logging
* Flash filesystem
* Build and package management

== Blinky
[source,C]

void main()
{
    sysinit();

    g_led_pin = LED_BLINK_PIN;
    hal_gpio_init_out(g_led_pin, 1);

    while (1) {
        /* Wait one second */
        os_time_delay(OS_TICKS_PER_SEC);

        /* Toggle the LED */
        hal_gpio_toggle(g_led_pin);
    }
}
--

== Multitasking
* Tasks priority based scheduling (250+ levels)
* High priority runs until sleep
* Tasks communicate/wake up via event queues 
* Most typically will be sleeping
* Tasks can wake up on messages, timer, I/O, network or watchdog
* Tasks and event queues have debug info

== Multitasking
[source,C]

    while (1) {
        os_time_delay(1000);
        hal_gpio_toggle(LED_BLINK_PIN);
    }

    while (1) {
       os_eventq_run(os_eventq_dflt_get());
    }
}
--

== HAL
* Hardware abstraction layer
* Implemented for each MCU, so all low-level features work
* Drivers sit on top of HAL
* Drivers support power management
* Sensor framework sits on top of drivers

== Supported boards
* Cortex M0-M4 + M7 micro controllers
* MIPS
* RISC-V

[.notes]
--
STM NUCLEO and others, Adafruit Feather nRF Nordic Semiconductor, RuuviTag
High-end Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BBS micro
--

== Bluetooth
* Bluetooth Low Energy supports 4.2 and 5
* Full stack, host only, or controller only
* Up to 32 connections! 2Mbps throughput 
* Configurable features to tune size
* Portable can swap chips

== WiFi
* Native support for TCP/IP and UDP
* Currently mostly low speed (MKR1000)
* Supports CoAP and 6LoWPAN

== FileSystem
* Newtron Flash File system (nffs)
* Minimal ram usage
* Work still needs to be done on encryption and compression

== Sensors
* Sensor framework
* Sit on top of drivers and HAL

== Sensors

== Projects and Packages
* Projects are a collection of packages
* Projects are released and versioned in repositories
* Packages defined dependencies and build settings

== Packages
* Maintain and reuse package across multiple projects
* Pick and choose what you need
* Manage debug and production build setups
* Know what versions you are using
* Supports external and internal packages
* Easy to find 3rd party packages
* Doesn't use make (yet)
