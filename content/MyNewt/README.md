# Apache Mynewt - ASF's Embedded OS Project

Apache Mynewt is an operating system for low powered embedded systems based on 32-bit microcontrollers. At the core, it is a small pre-emptive RTOS and an extensive set of modules for connectivity, file systems, power and performance management options and lots more. It is a highly flexible, responsive, general purpose OS for constrained devices, think of it as embedded Linux for devices that canâ€™t run Linux. Features include a secure bootloader, image management, hardware abstraction, instrumentation for stats and logs. This makes it easy to go from prototype to production when using Apache Mynewt without having to reinvent the wheel.

## Technology Used

The slides are generated from [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org) markup and displayed with [reveal.js](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/). This means the content can be kept under version control and exported to a number of formats other than HTML.

## How to Build

To install the needed dependencies on OSX run:

`install-deps.sh`

Then run:

`mvn clean compile`

## How to View the Slides

Once built, the generated slides can be found at:

`target/generated-slides/index_en.html`

Just open the `index_en.html` in a browser to view the slides.

Some features require the slides to be viewed via a http/https url you can do this by running:

`mvn jetty:run-exploded`

And goto `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index_en.html` in a browser to view.

If you add ?print-pdf at the end of the URL, you can then print the slide deck into a PDF document.

Some key shortcuts that may help you give a presentation:

- Cursor keys and space can navigate the slides.
- Press S will show speaker notes and a timer in a separate window.
- Press F for full screen.
- Press N for next slide or P for previous slide.
- Press O (for overview) will show a slide map / overview.
- Press B will black the screen.
