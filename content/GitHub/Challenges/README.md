# GitHub

Several projects at the Apache Software Foundation are using Git and GitHub for
their daily business. However not all potential contributors are comfortable
using that toolset - or are aware of how deep their knowledge of that tooling
is.

This directory contains small challenges that can help gauge interest in
learning more about Git and GitHub: One example use case would be printing the
challenges and putting them in a location where people have time for reading and
chatting - think of your closest coffee machine. Alternatively regularly post
one in your organisation's favourite chat system.
