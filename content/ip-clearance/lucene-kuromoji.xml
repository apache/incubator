			<title>Description</title>
			<p>The project was started in 2010 since we couldn't find any
				high-quality, actively maintained and easy-to-use Java-based
				Japanese morphological analyzers, and these become many of our
				design goals for Kuromoji.

				Kuromoji also has a segmentation mode that
				is particularly useful for
				search, which we hope will interest Apache
				Lucene and Solr users.
				Compound-nouns, such as &#x95a2;&#x897f;&#x56fd;&#x969b;&#x7a7a;&#x6e2f; (Kansai
				International Airport) and
				&#x65e5;&#x672c;&#x7d4c;&#x6e08;&#x65b0;&#x805e; (Nikkei Newspaper), are segmented
				as one token with most
				analyzers. As a result, a search for &#x7a7a;&#x6e2f;
				(airport) or &#x65b0;&#x805e; (newspaper)
				will not give you a for in these words.
				Kuromoji can segment these
				words into &#x95a2;&#x897f; &#x56fd;&#x969b; &#x7a7a;&#x6e2f; and &#x65e5;&#x672c; &#x7d4c;&#x6e08; &#x65b0;&#x805e;, which is
				generally what you would
				want for search and you'll get a hit.

				The
				target was to make sure the technology has a license that makes it
				compatible with other Apache Software Foundation software to
				maximize its usefulness. Kuromoji has an Apache License 2.0 and all
				code is currently owned by Atilika Inc. The software has been
				developed by Masaru Hasegawa and
				Christian Moen.</p>
