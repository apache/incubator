          <p>
For a new PMC member being voted in, follow the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newpmc">standard
procedure</a>.  For an ASF Member exercising their prerogative to join the IPMC by request, the only change in procedure
is to alter the text of the NOTICE sent to the Board:
          </p>
        <pre>
To: board at apache.org
CC: private at incubator.apache.org
Subject: [NOTICE] Jane Doe for Incubator PMC
Body: 

Apache Member Jane Doe has requested to join the Incubator PMC.
        </pre>
        
        <p>
After the NOTICE period expires, a welcome message should be sent to the new IPMC member.
        </p>
        <pre>
Welcome to the Apache Incubator Project.

Here is some information to get you started as a PMC member.

 - please subscribe to the incubator mailing lists:
    - general-subscribe at incubator.apache.org
    - private-subscribe at incubator.apache.org
    - cvs-subscribe at incubator.apache.org
     
 - the base incubator URL is http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator
 
 - all the public information, rules and policies about the
   Apache Incubator is in
   https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/public/trunk/, 
   and thus published on http://incubator.apache.org/

 - http://home.apache.org/phonebook.html?ctte=incubator
   lists all PMC members. This is periodically regenerated from
   https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt.

 - the Incubator website is maintained and published according to the
   instructions at http://incubator.apache.org/guides/website.html
   
 - status documents about Incubating projects are under 
   incubator/public/trunk/content/project/ directory; 
   please keep the ones you are mentoring updated

 - all committers on all incubating projects have access to
   the 'incubator/public' repository, so they can
   participate in the general Incubator Project as committers

 - please read our work documents under 
   incubator/public/trunk/content/incubation/
   for more information about the incubation process; they are
   published under http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/

Thanks for helping us!

      <section id="Making+the+Board+Report">
        <title>Board Report</title>
          <p>
The Incubator <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting">reports</a> monthly to the Apache <a
href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/board">Board of Directors</a>.  The report itself is the collaborative effort of
many Incubator contributors, but the Chair is ultimately responsible for ensuring that it is filed.  </p>

          <p>
The Board appreciates receiving the IPMC report:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>on time</li>
            <li>in a consistent format</li>
            <li>with an accurate summary of the state of the reporting podlings</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
The "runbook" for managing the preparation of the report is implemented as a script which prints out documentation,
instructions, literal commands, due dates, etc:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/public/trunk/report_runbook.py">report_runbook.py</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
Many of the tasks documented in the runbook may be attended to by either the Chair or a designee such as a "Report
Manager", but it's the Chair who is accountable for overseeing the process.
          </p>
