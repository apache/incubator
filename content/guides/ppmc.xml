    <section id="PPMC">
      <title>Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC)</title>
        <p>The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) helps a
        Podling learn how to govern itself.  It works like a PMC but
        reports to the Incubator PMC instead of to the ASF Board.
        Initially, it is composed of the Podling's mentors and initial
        committers.  The PPMC is directly responsible for the oversight
        of the podling and it also decides who to add as a PPMC member.</p>
        
        <p>For general information about PMCs, see the <a
        href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html">PMC FAQ</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="PPMC+Mail+List">
      <title>Private Mail List</title>
 
        <p>A private mail list, named <em>project</em>-private, lets 
        the PPMC discuss confidential topics.
        <em>Most communication should be on the Podling's dev list!</em>
        The private list is used only for confidential discussions that
        should not be made public, such as the suitability of a
        particular individual to become a committer or a member of the
        PPMC. See the ASF <em>How it Works</em> section titled <a
        href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#confidential">
        Balancing confidentiality and public discussion</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The mentors should verify that all PPMC members are actually
        subscribed to the private list. Mailing list moderators can
        request the list of subscribers using ezmlm commands, and any
        subscriber can send a "ping - please reply" message to check
        who is actually "listening" to the PPMC list.
        </p>

      <p><b><em>Don't mix private and public lists in posts!</em></b></p>

         <ul>
           <li>Don't post to both the dev and private lists.
               Each member of the PPMC should be on the dev list, so posting
               to dev is sufficient.</li>
           <li>Likewise, don't post to both the Incubator general and
               Incubator private lists. Each member of the Incubator PMC is on
               the Incubator general list, so posting to general is
               sufficient.</li>
         </ul>
    <p>
    Note that the lists used to be named <em>project</em>-ppmc or
    pmc@<em>tlp</em>, so you may see those names referenced in other ASF 
    documentation or in the mail list archives. It was 
    <a href="&root-path;/official/mailing-lists.html#july-2005">resolved</a>
    that these lists should be named <em>private</em> 
    to make it clear that they should be used for confidential discussion, 
    not as a general purpose way to contact (P)PMC members.

    <section id="Incubator+ASF+Board+Reports">
      <title>Podling Status Reports</title>
      <p>On a regular basis, reports from each incubating project are
      aggregated and sent to the ASF Board. Watch the Incubator general
      mail list for when these become due.</p>
      <p>The Incubator reports to the ASF Board monthly and includes
      status for a subset of the incubating projects. Currently new
      Podlings report to the Incubator monthly for the first three
      months, then quarterly thereafter. The <a
      href="../report-groups.txt">
      reporting schedule</a> is generated from podlings.xml.</p>

      <p>The PPMC does not have to fill out the report itself; the PPMC
      is just responsible for making sure that it gets filled out. In
      fact, it is better to discuss the report on the dev list and ask
      Podling developers to contribute to it. If Mentors disagree with
      the posted report, they should say so; otherwise, the Incubator
      PMC will assume that it speaks for the community.</p>

      <p>Please add the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Project name and one-line summary.</li>
        <li> Date of entry to the Incubator.</li>
        <li> Top three items to resolve before graduation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here are the points to be addressed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board
            specifically needs to address?</li>
        <li>Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or
            personal issues that need to be addressed?  (Are
            there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)</li>
        <li>Check that the project's Incubation 
            <a href="../projects/index.html">Status</a> file up to date.
            (Also provide the URL.)</li>
        <li>What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the
            last report?</li>
        <li>What are the plans and expectations for the next period?</li>
        <li>Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more 
            smoothly for you?</li>
        <li>etc. (your own thoughts on what is important would be
            helpful!)</li>
      </ul>

       <p>It is required for mentors to sign off on podling reports.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Mentors must sign off on the podling report.  If there is no mentor sign off, the report from that podling will not be accepted and they will be moved to monthly, expected to report next month.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Podling reports get added to the Incubator wiki</p>
       <ul>
	     <li>All podling reports must be added to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/">Incubator wiki</a></li>
	     <li>Follow the instructions in your monthly reminder, and post on the &lt;Month&gt;&lt;Year&gt; page, with the provided template</li>
	   </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="Project+Status+Updates">
      <title>Project Status Page</title>
      <p>In addition to the quarterly status reports, each Podling has a
      page on the Incubator web site that tracks the status
      (see the <a
      href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/index.html">complete
      list</a> for examples). Instructions for updating the status page
      are in the <a href="website.html">Incubator web site guide</a>
      under <a href="website.html#Edit+your+project+status+page">Edit
      your project status report</a>.</p>
      <p>This is one of the primary
      <a href="mentor.html#Overview">sources</a>
      of information about your podling's
      status to the Incubator PMC and to the general public.  Be sure to
      keep it updated as your podling progresses!</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Voting+in+a+new+committer">
      <title>Adding new committers</title>

      <p>Adding new committers is one of the most important functions
      of any PMC, and Incubator podlings are no different.</p>

      <p>There are no ASF wide rules on how to decide when to make someone 
      a committer, podlings need to agree an approach that works for them. 
      Some ASF projects have a high bar requiring significant contributions before
      someone is considered, other projects grant it more freely to anyone
      who shows interest in contributing. Some projects use formal [DISCUSS] and
      [VOTE] threads on the private mailing list, others use a more lazy consensus
      approach. For more information see,<a
      href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#CommitAccess">
      commit access</a> and the ASF <em>How it Works</em> document,
      which explains <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy">
      meritocracy</a> and <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles">
      roles</a>.</p>

      <p>The podling Incubator reports should document any new committers 
      added since the last report.</p>

      <p>Once the decision has been made the proposer offers committership 
      to the nominee. If the nominee accepts the responsibility of being 
      a committer for the project, the nominee formally becomes an 
      Apache committer.</p>

      <p>The proposer then asks an Incubator PMC member (typically one of
      the mentors) to follow the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter">documented</a>
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#SVNaccess">procedures</a> 
      to complete the process. If the nominee is already an Apache
      committer on another project, the Incubator PMC member simply
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#SVNaccess">updates</a>
      the SVN authorization settings to include the nominee as a committer
      on the podling.
      </p>
      <p>The proposer then directs the new committer to the <a 
      href="http://www.apache.org/dev/">Apache developer's pages</a>, 
      to the  <a 
      href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator site</a> 
      and to the Incubator <a 
      href="committer.html">Committers Guide</a> for important additional 
      information.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the proposer should update the Podling status page to
      list the new committer there. For projects which wish to have all
      committers also be PPMC members, the "Voting in a new PPMC member"
      guide below should then be followed, noting that if desired it
      is possible to run a joint committership and PPMC vote, providing
      that the guidance for both is followed.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Voting+in+a+new+PPMC+member">
      <title>Voting in a new PPMC member</title>
      <p>It should be a goal of a podling to have all committers participate 
      in the PPMC. The PPMC should take an active role in watching 
      committers develop into community participants, identify those who 
      are participating at a community level, not just a technical one, 
      and approach them with an offer of PPMC membership.</p> 
      <p>Any member of the PPMC can propose a new member of the PPMC. The
      proposal should be discussed in private on the PPMC private alias,
      with a subject line of [DISCUSS] Joe Bob PPMC membership. If there
      is consensus that the proposed member is suitable, then there should
      be a formal vote in the PPMC private alias, with the subject line of
      [VOTE] Joe Bob PPMC membership.
      </p>
      <p>If the vote is successful, the proposer 
      should send a message to the PPMC private alias, with
      the subject line of [VOTE][RESULT] Joe Bob PPMC membership. The
      message id of the [VOTE][RESULT] message should be preserved for
      notifying the Incubator PMC. 
      The nominating PPMC member should send a message to 
      the IPMC (<a href="mailto:private@incubator.apache.org">
      private@incubator.apache.org</a>) with a reference to
      the vote result's message id of the following form:
      </p><p>to: private@incubator.apache.org
      </p><p>subject: New member of Frizzle PPMC Joe Bob
      </p><p>body: Joe Bob has been voted as a new member of the Frizzle PPMC. 
      </p><p>the vote thread is at:
      </p><p>msgid: 23985678912386778989056789659048357@sponsoring.member.org
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>It should noted that there is a grace period of 72 hours from when the
        above NOTICE is sent to the Incubator PMC to when the proposed member 
        is formally invited. This is an important part of the overall
        process. Failure to do this can result in an embarassing situation
        for people involved.</b> 
      </p>
      
      <p>After 72 hours, Joe Bob
      should be invited to join the PPMC, using a sample message like 
      <a href="ppmc-offer.txt">this</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Once the proposed member has accepted, the moderator for the 
      PPMC mail alias will accept the new member's subscription request.
      </p><p>The new member should be directed to 
      <a href="ppmc.html">this page</a> for PPMC membership information.  
      </p><p>The nominating member should also update the PPMC membership
      section of the Podling's status file. For projects which choose to
      always make new committers also PPMC members, simply updating
      the committer list and ensuring that a statement such as
      "The PPMC consists of all the committers and mentors listed here"
      is generally sufficient.

	  <title>Adding new mentors</title>
	  <p>At times, it may be desirable to add a new mentor to a podling.
		Under all circumstances, a mentor must be an IPMC member.</p>
	  <p>IPMC members are free to volunteer to be a mentor to a podling
		as they see fit.  To do so, they should mail the podling stating
		their intentions.  The podling should then decide if it wants to
		add the new mentor or not.  If a decision has been reached to 
		add the mentor, then all podling documentation should be updated
		to reflect the change (podlings.xml, projects/{podling}.xml) and
		the incubator be notified of the change as well.
	</p>
	<p>If a podling is in a position where they feel they need to add a new mentor,
		they may want to drop a mail on the general incubator mailing list to try
