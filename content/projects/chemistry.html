           <li>First formal incubator release. Although this is planned,

              Another project (OpenCMIS) targetting a Java implementation
              of CMIS, like Chemistry, has been proposed to the Incubator.
              Discussions between OpenCMIS and Chemistry developers have
              identified areas of possible collaboration but the OpenCMIS
              incubation status has not moved forward.

            The incubation process has started well. All the project
            infrastructure is in place and all initial committers have
            their Apache accounts. We even increased the headcount of the
            initial team as David Caruana joined the project as a new committer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Development of the Chemistry codebase has moved to Apache svn and
            there's been a number or related discussions on the mailing list.
            Overall the project is still in a startup phase as people are
            getting oriented with the scope and structure of the project.
            A number of license headers were updated to match Apache policies.

            The Chemistry project has just entered incubation and we've been
            busy getting started with everything. Most of the project
            infrastructure is already in place, all the CLAs have been
            received, and the initial codebases are now in Apache svn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Chemistry developers had a chance to meet in person in the
            CMIS PlugFest at the end of April, and the resulting energy has
            been visible also on the new Chemistry mailing lists. Among the
            results are updates to the core Chemistry codebase, a new
            JavaScript-based CMIS client codebase, and a proposal to
            contribute a Flex/Air -based CMIS explorer.
