Assemble a to-do list (roadmap) for future development and publish to
the jUDDI web site. Upgrade to Axis 1.2beta (Axis 1.1 is currently
bundled with jUDDI). Refactor CVS to create a areas for the jUDDI
java source directory, the jUDDI website and locations for addons,
contributions or prototypes that do not fit well in the jUDDI source

assumed they are one-in-the-same I'm not certain of that (perhaps you
can enlighten me). If they are not they same thing then I'm confused
about the need to keep status in two different places. Even this
status report is more or less a reformatted version the cwiki
