</h2>
<div class="section-content">
<p>The Apache 2.0 module mod_aspdotnet, and CLI implementation of
Apache.Web.Host, together form a hosting environment for ASP.NET
applications within Microsoft's .NET Framework for Windows, and the
Apache 2.0 httpd server running on Win32.
</p>
<p>This code was developed by William A. Rowe, Jr., Covalent
Technologies, Inc., and is donated to the Apache community as a
starting point for multiple avenues of CLI integration with the
Apache 2.0 httpd server.
</p>
<p>Microsoft, as part of it's .NET patents, asserts ownership of the
implementation of System.Web.Hosting, the framework under which
ASP.NET applications are instantiated. Note that this patent does not
assert the implementation of System.Web.Host, System.Web.Request and
other specific implementations of the server 'container' which
forwards ASP.NET requests to the .NET Framework's implementation of
System.Web.Hosting.
</p>
<p>The initial goal of the PMC is to release this ASP.NET implementation
of ASP.NET for he benefit of Apache httpd Win32 users.
</p>
<p>The second goal of the PMC will be to refactor the Microsoft COM/.NET
CLI thunks which exist in mod_aspdotnet, from the specific
implementation of the ASP.NET-based Apache.Web.Host container.
</p>
<p>Once the CLI thunk is a seperate and distinct component, the next two
goals, may occur in parallel;
</p>
<ul>
        <li>Abstract the Apache httpd request model as it's own CLI
implementation, allowing authors to handle native httpd requests
without the Microsoft specific ASP.NET model.
</li>
      </ul>
<ul>
        <li>Build alternate CLI thunks to other engines such as mono, to allow
CLI code to run on other platforms using the native Apache request
model.
</li>
      </ul>
<p>This goal allows CLI developers, to use tools such as C# to develop
Apache-based solutions using alternate CLI hosting environments such
as mono, without infringing on the claims of Microsoft which may
inhibit ASP.NET-based solutions on non-Windows operating systems.

<div class="section-content">
<ul>
        <li>19 July 2004
</li>
      </ul>
<p>In March '04, the httpd PMC referred the mod_aspdotnet contribution
(Code Grant ack'ed in rev 1.7 of foundation/grants.txt) for
incubation.
</p>
<p>The project was recently picked back up, with Will Rowe now having
the cycles to devote to the care and feeding required of incubation.
Ian Holsman, also an httpd PMC member, stepped up to co-shepherd the
incubation.
</p>
<p>Invites to the interested parties were sent last week to join the
mailing list cli-dev@httpd.apache.org, followed by an invitation to
the dev@httpd community. The status page/ip incubation template was
created, with Ian managing the site. Will has imported the initial
contribution into SVN (under asf/incubator/httpd/cli/).
</p>
<p>Next steps are documented in status, first posts will be sent to this
list this week. mod_aspdotnet should have an initial release soon,
followed by the refactoring of code to support an Apache.Web model
that is entirely independent of the Microsoft ASP.NET technology,
usable in C# with one of several CLI environments, including mono.
</p>
<p>The cli-dev team would like to thank Noel and Sander for their advise
and handholding through initial mailing list creation, SVN setup, and
general guidance on the incubation process.
</p>
<p>Will Rowe
</p>
<ul>
        <li>30 October 2004
</li>
      </ul>
<p>After soliciting a number of comments from cli-dev testers of the
mod_aspdotnet, and committing their patches to solve various bugs,
the subproject has extracted v2.0.0 release candidate 1 today.
</p>
<p>The installer was migrated to InstallShield X, the only and current
product for authoring .msi files from InstallShield. This, after
experience with converting the Apache 1.3.33 installer, turned out to
be fairly trivial, and the .ism project file did have an xml flavor
that can be tracked in svn.
</p>
<p>Next actions are creating a cli-users@httpd end-user list, declaring
v2.0.0 released, adding the tracking category in bugzilla, and moving
from incubator/httpd/cli to httpd/cli in svn, once graduated.
</p>

<p>Graduation Report
</p>
<p>December 16th is the date that the httpd-pmc vote was closed, this
sub-project adopted, the repositories and first release moved into
the httpd.apache.org domain, and officially kicked off. This had
included the cli-users@httpd list, cli-dev@httpd list, bugzilla
recordkeeping at issues.apache.org, and http://httpd.apache.org/cli/
home page.
</p>
<p>I would like to especially thank Ian for his extraordinary help,
simply navigating the particularities with the incubator's
infrastructure, and all of the interested users and developers who
have stepped up to this effort. A number of individuals are using
this in production, for their own development, and are coming up with
exciting challenges to overcome in the future.
</p>
<p>My appologies for taking so long to close the incubator pages, and
thank you to the incubation committee for helping promote this work.
</p>
