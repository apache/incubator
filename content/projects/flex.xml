Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:
   Flex has their graduation resolution on the agenda for the December board meeting.

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?
   Only the graduation resolution.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)
   The Flex community really wants to move from SVN to Git/GitHub.  We are eager to see
   Infra fully support read/write Git repos.

   Also, we are still waiting for INFRA-4380 (import the old Flex JIRA data) to
   be resolved.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?
   -We approved 6 new committers
   -We released Apache Flex SDK Installer 1.0.9-incubating.
   -Adobe Systems Inc. donated both the Falcon compiler and the FalconJS
    cross-compiler.
   -Christopher Dutz donated Maven support tools for Flex
   -We voted to graduate.
   -We started work on a next-generation of Flex designed to target browsers
    and devices without Flash.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

   -Go through the transition to being a TLP
   -Continue with the next-generation Flex work
   -Release several bug-fixes and new locales in the current Flex code base.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?
   No.  We thank you for your support.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A large community is waiting to see if committer activity will increase
and starting to think about graduating.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  - Get better at resolving issues the Apache Way
  - Get more initial committers to commit something
  - Make another release with more non-Adobe involvement

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  There was discussion about letting Flex graduate with the requirement that
  one or two mentors remain on the PMC.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  The issue regarding the import of attachments for existing
  JIRA bugs remains open (INFRA-4380).  It is not critical, but it would be
  nice to get this resolved soon.

  The PPMC has voted to move from SVN to Git.  Having Apache approve read/write
  Git repositories would be helpful.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - We released Apache Flex 4.8.0 (incubating).

  - OmPrakash Muppirala and Erik de Bruin were added as a committer and 
    PPMC member due to their work on the installer.  Peter Ent and 
    Gordon Smith from Adobe were also added as committers as they are 
    shepherding large donations from Adobe.

  - Adobe completed the trademark donation.

  - Adobe donated the Text Layout Framework, the rest of the Mustella
    test suite and signed off on the Falcon compiler donation.

  - OmPrakash Muppirala has been leading the development of a tool that
    allows IDEs like Adobe Flash Builder to work better with Apache Flex
    releases.  Justin McLean, Stephen Downs, Roland Zwaga, Tomasz Maciag,
    and Erik de Bruin have also contributed to the tool.

  - We have accepted several patches from the community to address issues
    with our test suite.

  - After much discussion, we voted to move from SVN to Git and employ
    something known as the Git Branching Model.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  - We hope to finalize the release of the installer.

  - Adobe will submit the Falcon compiler source

  - We will get the test suite stable on Mac desktops and then on Windows
    and mobile configurations.  This should remove the last excuse for
    committers who are afraid to make changes without a validation suite

  - We hope to complete the transition from SVN to Git.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Our mentors continue to be very helpful.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A large community is losing momentum as it waits for Adobe to
complete the source code transition and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  - Resolve trademark donation or licensing
  - Complete code and bug database donation
  - Make at least one release

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  The ASF legal team will have to agree to a custom Trademark licensing.
  Adobe submitted an initial proposal for the agreement at the end of May.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the import of existing
  JIRA bugs is blocked by an issue with Apache JIRA's import utility (INFRA-4380).
  We just got news that this should now be resolved, the PPMC is testing
  the results of the import before activating it.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - Carol Frampton is the release manager for our first release and has
    prepared some initial release candidates.  We are continuing to refine
    the release candidates to respond to various licensing and policy issues.
  - Christophe Herreman was added as a committer and PPMC member due to his 
    offering patches for issues with the release candidates.
  - OmPrakash Muppirala has been leading the development of a tool that
    allows IDEs like Adobe Flash Builder to work better with Apache Flex
    releases.  Justin McLean, Stephen Downs, Roland Zwaga, and Tomasz Maciag

  Adobe expects to complete the transfer of the mustella test suite.
  We hope to get an initial release approved by IPMC.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Our mentors continue to be very helpful.

  See May 2012 report for other concerns related to JIRA and svn imports,
  but as mentioned above it looks like the JIRA import problems are fixed 
  now.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A highly energetic community waits for Adobe to complete the
source code transition and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  1. Resolve trademark donation or licensing
  2. Complete code and bug database donation
  3. Make at least one release

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  The ASF legal team may have to agree to a custom Trademark licensing.
  Adobe is currently evaluating the parameters of a custom Trademark license
  proposed by an ASF Board member.  If approved, a custom agreement will be
  drafted and signed by both parties.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the import of existing
  JIRA bugs is blocked by an issue with Apache JIRA's import utility. It has
  failed to import the data file supplied by Adobe. Infra is supposed to
  open a support ticket with Atlassian.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - An initial set of Flex source (base framework code), including history,
    was checked into the trunk area of the podling’s Subversion repository.
  - Other initial committers have donated code to the whiteboard.
  - Updates to the podling's wiki including a getting started area for
    reference to new project members.
  - Justin Mclean was accepted as committer to the podling.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  Adobe expects to complete the transfer of the bug database. Adobe also
  hopes to contribute the compiler and test suite as well. And there is hope
  for an initial release.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Incubation has been working well.  Our mentors are great.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A highly energetic community waits for Adobe to transition code
and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top four items to resolve before graduation:

  1. Resolve trademark donation or licensing
  2. Complete code and bug database donation
  3. Make at least one release
  4. Add new committers

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  The ASF legal team will have to work with Adobe on the Trademark
  licensing issue.  Adobe legal is still drafting the proposal before
  presenting to Apache.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the code donation and
  bug database donation are being slowed by infrastructure issues at both
  Adobe and Apache, mainly the lack of ways to easily transfer multi-GB files.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - An initial set of Flex source (minus Subversion history) was checked into
    the whiteboard area of the podling’s Subversion repository.
  - Other initial committers have donated code to the whiteboard.
  - A logo contest was held.  Over 50 entries were submitted.
  - The mailing lists were established.  Over 200 people joined in the
    first 30 days and the traffic averaged over 100 emails a day.  It has
    quieted down now that the logo contest has concluded.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  Adobe expects to complete the transfer of the bug database and the initial
  set of code with history.  Adobe also hopes to contribute the compiler and
  test suite as well.  And there is hope for an initial release.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for you?

  Incubation has been working well.  Our mentors are great.
