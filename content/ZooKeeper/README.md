# Apache ZooKeeper

This directory contains a brief introduction into Apache ZooKeeper.


## Building the presentation

By running the following command, you can generate the presentation:

    mvn clean package
   
## Running the presentation

In order to start a local web server serving the presentation (English translation), execute the following command:

    mvn jetty:run-exploded

(The selected language is configurable in the `<configuration><war>` element of the `jetty` plugin in `pom.xml`.)
    
As soon as that's done, just point your browser to:

    http://localhost:8080/

## Generating PDF versions

In order to generate a PDF version of the presentation just add `?print-pdf` to the url. (Keep in mind, that you have to add it before any `#blahblah`)

The following link should do the trick:

    http://localhost:8080/?print-pdf
    
As soon as that's loaded, just use the normal `print` functionality of the browser and `print as PDF`.
